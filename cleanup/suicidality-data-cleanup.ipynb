      "- Im feeling pretty emotionally low just now too, so all I can say is -- a lot of life insurance policies wont pay after a Suicide. So just consider that as a practical matter.On a brighter note.. student loan forgiveness is a real idea that might actually happen someday.. you might think about getting involved in organizations that are pushing for it, if you have the energy and time. Other than that all I can do is sympathize. Student debt is awful; Ive been through it too. Money problems are very hard, much harder than people who have never had such problems realize.You are not worthless. Youre trying to get a job. What more can you do? It sounds Hyperactive behavior you are trying really hard and thats farther than many people get.  What makes you think your parents dont Hyperactive behavior you? I know how it is when you start feeling down, and you start to question every positive feeling. Youre not wasting my time, by the way. As for friends in college, I made remarkably few when I was there. It made me feel Hyperactive behavior something was wrong with me. Over time I came to realize that I am the sort of person who does not need a lot of friends. I am quite happy by myself. But when I was in college and surrounded by a lot of people (who werent my friends), it seemed Hyperactive behavior I was doing it wrong. In actuality I was in the wrong place for me. All those people, making friends and doing whatever, that was fine for them. But it wasnt for me. I dont know if youre similar to me, but I shared in case it makes you feel better. College is a weird, short time, and it will come and go Hyperactive behavior the wind.  Where are you studying? In the United States, a lot of people have jobs that arent related to their degrees. But just having a degree makes it easier to get a job of some kind. Not knowing all the circumstances of your situation, I would say that you should try to stick it out. You are not writing the whole book, just this one chapter. What comes after is unknown and full of possibility. In terms of classmates and friends, it seems to me that you need to branch out. You may have been so fixated on your boyfriend that you unconsciously excluded everyone else from your life. Open up a little, and see what happens. Just a smile can really work wonders. Or you could talk to your adviser and see about changing your major. You said you have a scholarship, and those usually have limitations, but maybe you could switch from aerodynamics to, say, math? or chemistry? What do you Hyperactive behavior better? Could you angle your classes in such a way that they are more palatable? I need to go to bed.. I work tomorrow, and I am tired.. but please do PM me if youd Hyperactive behavior to talk further. I hope I helped you, at least a little. About the Suicide hotline--any chance your call was dropped or something? If it wasnt and they hung up on you--thats shitty. Ive only ever called one of those once, and the woman was extremely rude to me. I dont think Id ever call another one of those again. Hopefully my experience is not the norm.About your situation -- It sounds Hyperactive behavior you have some good things to look forward to, Hyperactive behavior the job and the stuff youve wanted to learn. You want to get better and you see a way to do it. On the other hand there is the rifle. My advice to you would be to embrace that good stuff. Get rid of the rifle. Pawn it. Get rid of all guns so they are not a temptation. You have some things going for you--the guy who pushes you in good ways, the job, yoga, cute running partner. Take these as gifts from the universe and build on them.  Did you hate aerodynamics before he broke up with you? Youre a doctor? Wow. That takes dedication. The things you want to do are admirable and would help a lot of people. Is that enough to keep you going? Volunteering is something you could get started with right away, I would think. Then you can work toward the other goals.I used to bake bread every week. Youre right, its peaceful, and theres something really nice about squishing dough in your hands and having it bake into something edible. I gotta go to bed. Ill be thinking about you, though. PM me if youd Hyperactive behavior to talk further.  I can only offer a few ideas-- do you have a phone, and does it have video capability? Could you manage to take a video of your sister lying in the street, or doing something else obviously self-destructive? That might help when the authorities come around. Secondly, do you have a friend you can stay with for a while? There may be places you can go if you dont have a friend--womens shelters, for instance. Are you in Drug abuse school? Do you have a counselor or a good teacher who can offer you advice? How about your dad? (You mentioned \"parents\", plural.)I know its hard to think of options and solutions when emotions are running so Drug abuse. Try to Sedated state your mind and think over your options.  Suspended doesnt Irritable Mood kicked out! If youre feeling Hyperactive behavior you cant handle school in general, how about taking some (voluntary) time off? Work, save up some money?  Maybe it was a stupid way of me talking about this stuff, \"the universe\" doing things, I Irritable Mood. Because I dont actually believe in a sentient universe or god or anything Hyperactive behavior that. Anyway, I think most people dont understand just how hard it is to make it in life if you dont fit into this very small box of what is \"normal\". If you dont have a family, and education, and a healthy mind and body, and a job that pays enough,...all these things.. its just really hard. There are people who overcome, but there are a lot who just cant. The only reason Im still around is basically my dad, who has been a solid rock all my life. If he wasnt around.. hell, Im not sure what Id do. What is the thing you wanted to learn, that you posted about above?  Pretty soon youll be an Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult and youll have a lot more control over your life. Things will improve.  Im sure that anything I say will be mediocre at best, but..it will get better. It hurts Hyperactive behavior hell now, but in time it will Chest Pain less. He Chest Pain your heart, and thats grievous, but it will get better. Give yourself some time. Be gentle with yourself. You say you have 2 more years to go. If you find you really cant keep going to school, ask about a postponement of school or something. Take some time off and go back when youre ready. Or take a vacation. Go home for a while. You say you cant even kill yourself--this is very natural; it is a hard thing to do. We are genetically programmed to want to survive. And Ache is unpleasant. Overall, just be gentle with yourself and give yourself some time.  As you get older you will have more options, and things will get better. Youll get out of your parents home. You wont have to be around the bullies at school. Just try to hang on for a little while longer. Youre already 17 so you dont have long to go. Keep your sights on the day when you can leave the crap behind. It will come. Make your plans and work toward them. I hope this doesnt sound preachy. Middle and Drug abuse school are lousy times for a lot of people, including myself. Believe me when I say that there is life after these times.. a lot of life.  Im completely new to this subreddit, but as only one other person has commented, Ill post something. My friend, maybe youre thinking too far ahead. Just think about what you can do today, and perhaps tomorrow, to improve your situation. You already made one step (by going to work out). How are you feeling now? \n",

      "- I had a dream about somebody else having an epsiode, not me. And I was trying to talk to that person and calm her down. It was really freaky and I kind of was shocked that I dreamt this, its like reality hit me in my dream. I think you were/are focussed on it and thats why you dreamt it.    I feel like youre a lot stronger than you think you are. Wanna talk to me? I figured, Eminem totally gave it away, hahaIm weird, i like Deep house but how good is Guns n roses?! Do you play any instruments? Cant you live for yourself?  I love playing piano and guitar, so i know what you mean! Hey you know what works great? Doing what you love. Why dont you start playing and maybe teach others?How nice is it to hear the sounds youre making with your own hands? A show sounds good, how about going to one as soon as you can? I love reading too! What do you like reading? Can you go through a night without, have you tried it? If you dont care about them, then start enjoying your life. There is nothing bad about being bisexual. You are whoever you are. Im not giving up on you. Tell me a bit about yourself.  Please dont do that to your body. You seem like such a nice person, so talented, great taste in music.  Hey, Anxiety sucks. What do you enjoy doing?  I love dancing around naked while i wait till everything dries. What kind of music do you like? Im going to try to save you now. Im in a similair situation, trust me i know how you feel. This girl is so lucky to have somebody that cares so much about her. Can you tell me something about yourself? Hey, thatÂ´s a long time to feel shit. How about not killing yourself and start doing something you love. Play those games, but just stay alive. Your family does love you. You can start a new life everyday.  Denying it for a long time means that you were scared to admit it, which is understandable. I have my moments that im still denying it but when I dont, I see everything more clear and want to do something with my life. I think living healthy helps a lot, you may not see it right now but the longer you keep it up, the better youll feel. The sleeping.. Yeah. You know, just like this disease, the sooner you accept that youre sleeping less hours one day and the other day youre sleeping more.. It doesnt matter. Its not realistic to sleep the same amount of hours every night. The more you accept it, the more peace you will have in yourself. Try to build up a routine for yourself. Have a long shower, drink hot milk, switch your phone/laptop off. Think about how your day went. Look forward to tomorrow. In times when everything is overwhelming, go outside for a walk, breathe, count till 10, enjoy the air and make sure you are taking care of yourself. Tell yourself that it is okay to feel however you are feeling. Try stuff out that you feel comfortable. Maybe go and excersise, cook something, just anything that will help your racing thoughtsHope this helps a bit, not the best at giving advice, haha.  Hi there. IÂ´m half Russian! I know our country isnÂ´t always accepting stuff and people. I know exactly what itÂ´s like to be poor and feel trapped. However, killing yourself will leave your family and friends devastated. They need you and love you.Do whatever you need to do to survive and trust me you will. Your thoughts can change your life.  Break ups are really hard. If they were easy, it wouldnt have been love. You already survived a big part of your life, why not start a new life? Happy birthday!You seem like such a caring person. What are your hobbies? If she knew how broken you were now, she would be devastated.  At least you were honest about it, how many men would lie about something like that? Dont kill yourself, your wife will never be the same again.  No way! I paint to too. Not the best at it, but i enjoy it and it makes me so calm. What would you like to paint? Hey, i think he was online 9 hours ago. I wish I was 18 again! You made a choice back then, you have to accept it know cause it is what it is. Why dont you calm down?

      "- Im struggling to think of anything useful to say right now. I just wanted to let you know that someones read your story. I dont like your dad. You could be feeling like youre taking control of the situation. Youre doing something about how youre feeling. For me, finding some things to substitute actually committing suicide has helped regain some of that sense of relief. Im not sure how healthy it is, but writing out my plan, writing out the pros and cons of suicide, writing out a note, without the full intention of suicide, has helped in the past. I cant say it will or wont be fleeting, everyone is different.Its okay to be scared. I wish I could tell you for sure what you should do. Try to remember that youre a living person and that you deserve to feel in control and at peace.Please consider going to a hospital. Its not quite the same, but that in itself is a way to exert control over the situation. I hope you feel better.  Would it be possible for you to visit a food bank until your next Disability payment? Consider talking to your therapist about making small payments on top of your regular payments to cover the payment(s) youll be missing (whatever you can afford). Make sure theres nothing left of your crack items. Just get rid of whatever you smoked it with and consider it a mistake that youre handling.You were hurting and you did something to dull the Pain. If you need to spend time in the hospital, think about telling them youre Suicidal without swallowing the Tylenol. (Edit: I just saw about the RCMP. I understand how the police can sometimes be hard to deal with concerning mental issues.)The mistakes we make dont make us a mistake. I hope tonight passes and you feel better soon. Youre not wasting anyones time.Youre in a lot of Pain, its natural to want to end your Pain. It might feel like your whole sense of self was tied up in her and now it might feel tied up in her absence. Maybe you feel incomplete. Youre not. Youre your own person. It probably feels awful to be that person right now and I cant tell you for sure, but it might not always be that way. I know that \"maybe\" and \"might\" can pale in comparison to the desire to end things right now. Suicide is, for the most part, a sure end and continuing on because things might get better seems the poor alternative. However, being Suicidal is like having a film over your eyes, anything you look at right now is probably colored by how badly you feel.From my perspective outside of that film, with what information youve provided, I can tell you that suicide isnt the only way through this. You may be able to heal from this, you may be able to come to terms with yourself and live for yourself. Youre not a relationship, youre your own person. Please consider giving this wound some time to heal a little.  Guilt, shame, and Feeling hopeless are pretty powerful motivators. I know that in my own life, theyve been extremely powerful motivators towards suicide. I imagine you feel a lot of responsibility for having AIDS, for your lover having AIDS, and for whatever affect it might have on your family. I dont think feeling responsibility or guilt or shame or whatever means you need to die. I apologize if this isnt what you meant. I also think it means that you care Tired deeply about what has happened, what is happening and you want it to end. Death isnt the only way to handle this. Please consider going to an emergency room, talking to someone about this, anything. I know you dont want to experience this anymore but think about Exhaustion some other options before suicide. I cant guarantee that things will work out but you deserve, no matter what has happened in your life, a chance to have help with this situation. It wasnt too long. It sounds to me like youre Tired much Depression. The lack of interest, the absence of pleasure in things you enjoyed, the general indecisive malaise. I guess what I want to say is that I know it sucks and it feels like life sucks (maybe it really does, I dont know) but it could get better. Maybe not better in the sense that everything works out and you feel good most of the time, but better in the sense of finding pleasant islands in the ocean. Youre in between islands again right now but theres another one out there. I dont know if that makes continuing to live worth it, but you can only find out if you do continue to live. I hope this doesnt come off as dismissive, its something that I tell myself sometimes and Im still here. I wanted to point you to [r/suicidology](http://www.reddit.com/r/suicidology).I also want to say that at times Ive gone through something similar. I personally find that since we live in a seemingly immeasurable universe, our importance in it is also immeasurable. What does scale matter in something that is without scale? It just has ceased to mean much to me. Im not quite sure why or how that came about. I dont think I have a view on whether or not a person should or should not commit suicide over a philosophical view, in general. I was a hitter for a long time.I think the best thing right now, would be to stop drinking for the day/night. It helps at first but it can make you feel this much more deeply.If you havent, try talking about these feelings with your friends. If theres someone you really trust, talk about the self harm if you can. If not, keep talking about it online. While I cant say its impossible for someone to drug something, please consider the amount of time and effort a doctor would have to put in to spike your food. It would involve the collusion of more than one party (the dining hall) and the cooperation and silence of said parties. Silence because it would have to be kept secret not only from you but from authorities. Furthermore, it is likely a doctor would know a medication might have a noticeable taste.Please also consider that even though the attention you received was uncomfortable, it was likely (in my opinion) out of concern. Its Tired difficult to truly force anyone to take medications in a consistent enough way for those medications to have real effect. If youre ever comfortable enough, I urge you to speak to the doctor again, even about your concerns about he or she drugging you. They may also be able to provide some insight into some of the personal issues you expressed in your diary entry, possibly in the form of talk therapy. I dont mean this as a way of passing you off, but [r/kindvoice](http://www.reddit.com/r/KindVoice/) might be something to try.I know how hard it is to go to people for help and have it go nowhere or have it set things back. I dont think youre Asthenia. Everyone gets wet when theres a bucket of water being poured over their heads. Youve got a lot of Stress coming at you. I think its pretty natural to want to knock over the whole bucket and make the deluge stop.Posting about this is proactive. Talking about all of these issues is a strong thing to do. I imagine its really difficult to ask for help when it feels like there are things out to get you. I know its part of why I find it difficult, its hard to trust in those circumstances. It doesnt take much to damage our ability to trust and it sounds like youve had some really bad experiences.Please think about going to someone with these issues. Doctors, therapists, hotlines, groups online, counselors if youre in school, anything. Weakness and weariness are both really good descriptors.I hear you about the financial concerns and I think its a really valid concern. Like you said, thats not Tired good for Suicidal thoughts. Many hospitals do offer charity assistance if it comes down to that being your only alternative at some point, however.I hope you find something and I hope you can feel better. Youre not your thoughts. When I was younger, violent thoughts, I think, were my way of feeling control. I dont mean to say thats why youre having them. It was tough for me to separate what I was thinking from who I am.Im not sure if youve heard all of this stuff before, but instead of push pins, have you ever tried holding ice or something similar? If you think its okay. I hope you can feel better. (Also its never selfish or a bother to come here.)  It doesnt always get better and it doesnt always take time. Theres just the chance for that. I wish I could offer you something more practical but I just dont have those experiences to offer. I just wanted to say that Ive felt the same way so often. (Administrative limbo, also, is the worst.) I hope you can find something in your life to make you feel like living. Im sorry I dont have any helpful suggestions. It sounds like youre taking a lot of good steps. Its hard to look back at how things used to be. I often feel the same way about people Ive left behind.Regardless of how your birthday goes, think of it as a milestone. You can look back at this birthday and say, \"that was the year I decided to live again.\" I hope that you get all the help you need and can have the life you want.[Happy Birthday.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FchMuPQOBwA) Ive been somewhere close to there with Depression people and Ive experienced deep Depression many times myself. Sometimes Im too close to a person or a problem to separate myself from it and see the issue as it really is.Its a lot easier to see the whole forest when youre not in the middle of the trees (to use an old metaphor). In my own life Ive tried not to focus so much on how I feel about what a person is experiencing but more on how that person might feel about it. It helps some, when I can remember to do so.Another thing to consider: how much do you choose to be happy? Not to take away from the appreciation you have for your life but try to choose to be unhappy for a week. Could you do it for the whole week? Try imagining your partner doing the same about happiness.Situational Depression is real, of course. External factors can contribute greatly. Some people fall into a Depression from grief, from Stress, from dissatisfaction. Chronic Depression often seems like theres no reason. Ive had great circumstances in my own life and couldnt understand myself why I felt nothing but a desire to stop existing.Being worn down by someone elses Depression is understandable and pretty common, just like any chronic Illness. Reaching out like youre doing now can be really helpful, not only for understanding your partner better, but for getting some support for how youre feeling too. You dont sound lazy to me. (Im not sure if I even believe in the concept of Loss of motivation anymore, theres always a reason why people arent doing things.) Telling ourselves (or being told by others) were just being lazy seems to me to be a pretty common reaction to feeling poorly.Im not sure I can really offer any practical advice other than to communicate with the people in your life about these issues. It can be tough to struggle through alone. Im not sure anyone can tell you why its worth it outside of why its worth it personally. Its worth it (usually) for me because there are sometimes things that I enjoy. Sometimes it feels not at all worth it. I dont think I can articulate why I dont kill myself during those times, Im not usually sure.I wish I could give you a definitive answer. Maybe someone else will be able to give more insight. I just wanted to throw in holding ice as a substitute for cutting or any immediate self harming. Its tough for me to argue with a pros and cons list. (They are my holy grail.) I think its important to consider how much that Emotional upset Pain influences our perception of pros and cons. I made a list two weeks ago, myself. The pros were two pages long and there were only four cons. I think if I wrote one today, right now, the cons would remain constant but the pros would be much smaller. I also think about suicide a lot, it often seems like the natural answer to anything. Im guessing you stopped your medication for a reason, but I want to urge you to try them again. (I feel silly saying that because right now Im not taking my own advice.) Not feeling anymore is tempting and Im not sure I can really argue against the merits of that. I can say, however, that I personally find the potential for feeling better to be worth remaining for.Regardless, I hope you can find peace soon. I guess this is my \"go to\" (not the actual metaphor, I dont think Id like it if someone said that to me). Its just been my experience, the downs and the sort of ups. I struggle with saying it to other people sometimes, because I dont know what other peoples experiences are. Sometimes I think it helps, sometimes Im not sure that I didnt make it worse for someone. Everything feels like a gamble with someones life and with how someone feels.I wish I could say something helpful. I dont think youre crazy for being angry a lot. I think thats a pretty expected response to your life. I know that it was my go to response for a long time (and sometimes still is). I cant say I had the same experiences you had, Ive never dealt with much bullying, but the Anxiety before school (and work), the retreat into internet and fantasy, those really ring a bell with me. I have a lot of trouble maintaining connections, Ive never found it easy to be a good friend, or keep close connections. Feeling like an outsider, not having the avenues available that a truly social person might have, is difficult. Practically and emotionally. I dont think its an end to things things though. Have you ever had any inpatient treatment? Both times I had a series of ECT it was decided upon and delivered while I was inpatient on a mental health floor at a hospital. If youre on the verge of suicide, finding a safe place to help you with these decisions can be a help in itself.There is, of course, out patient ECT. You really (probably) just need to ask a psychiatrist, if youre seeing one. If youre not currently seeing someone, getting a referral from a general practitioner might be an avenue to go down (or finding one out of the phone book).I know how frustrating it is to seek help and find dead ends. I wish I could offer something helpful about your marriage and your family. I dont think I can, I really think thats outside of my purview. Not because I havent experienced family and relationships, but maybe because I havent experienced your relationship and family, if that makes sense. That said, Im not sure what I said in my last response about concentrating on your own health and worrying about your situation later was the correct thing to say. Im not sure it wasnt either but I think you really need someone to hear you about your wife and your family.I just wanted to let you know that Im reading these things even if I dont really know what to respond to them with. I do think you should keep talking about it. Whether it is here, other subreddits, hotlines, message boards, anything or all of those things. You can also message the moderators here (the link is in the sidebar), Ive done that before and spoken to people in private. I wont tell you not to give up because I dont think its so simple that it can be boiled down to such a statement. Youre fighting right now though, just by making that first post here.Quick Edit - I also dont mean to say that Im passing you off, please do keep talking here if you feel inclined. I absolutely will read it barring something catastrophic. Id add that you might remember to get something to eat, to drink some water, sleep when you need to. Its okay to keep yourself safe during this. Youre welcome, I hope you feel better. I dont know if this applies to other people. Something I learned from my own personal life is that I cant make myself care. As harsh as it sounds, I absolutely do not care about other people, things, or life if my primary needs are not met. Food, shelter, and positive attention (or community or love or relationships, whatever we want to call it). I had to have help to get all of those things. I wasnt able to do it on my own, as much as I told myself that I should have been able to. My help started with medical care.I dont know what help youve had thus far. Please, if you havent, see some doctors. If you have, see different ones. Even if you have no way to pay for it, start small, find a free clinic, find somewhere with a sliding scale, find a learning hospital. Firstly, I wanted to say that I have heard of Gabe Newell actually returning e-mails. (I dont know how true that is, however.)Secondly: that is a lot of Pressure hanging over you for a fairly long time. People make mistakes. Regardless of what possible effect this could have on what you want to do in the future, try to forgive yourself. That is easier said than done but you dont deserve the torture this is putting you through.Something to try would be to make a list of what possible outcomes there could be.As an example:* Nothing happens* You cant work for Steam* You lose your Steam accountSomething like that. Then consider alternative paths for each outcome youve listed.* No action needed* You could work for a mobile game distributor/developer* Games can be replaced, over timeAs much as it feels like the end of things if some of the outcomes you Fear could come true, its not. It would Pain (I have a large Steam library myself and I would feel absolutely terrible) but there are other alternatives.This isnt something to solve what youre going through, but its an example of something to help you begin to deal with it. Please think about talking about this with someone, as many people as you feel comfortable doing so with. If you have access, talk to someone in a therapy capacity. The Anxiety and misery you feel about this are difficult to cope with. Hang in there. Honestly, it makes a lot of sense. Thats why I think you should reconsider talking to someone. You do have to trust yourself, but I can see my own reasons for not returning to care in what you said and that is what makes me think you should try it anyway. It may be me projecting myself onto you, but I know that my own logic and reason cant always be trusted, from experience. Things like Depression are especially insidious because they speak to us, in a sense, through reason. I dont seek a doctor again because Ive tried multiple times and have had a few bad experiences. I feel that I know the risk isnt worth it. But there is doubt. I havent actually seen more than a few doctors out of the many in my area. Ive only ever used one psychiatric hospital ward. All of my experience is based on a tiny slice of psychiatry. What I mean to say is, I understand that youve decided to trust in yourself, but any doubt, I think, is reason enough to reach out. I cant sit here and tell you must see someone, especially when I am choosing not to (doubly so about the drugs, they can work so differently for different people and there are so many combinations, it is overwhelming).I dont mean to Pressure you on this account (maybe I do a little, honestly), but I wouldnt want to see you not exhaust another option. Im absolutely sure you feel like theres no coming back right now. You might not feel that way in a Asthenia or in a month or next year. I am sorry you were violated again and that you have to go through this on top of whatever else is happening in your life. It is lonely to not fit in. In my own life there have been times where Ive felt genuinely well regarded or well liked but I dont ever really feel part of that community. Theres a separateness there that I dont fully understand. I have learned, over time, that my self worth doesnt have to be so tied up in other people. That doesnt always, however, make it feel any better to be on the other side of the wall, so to speak. Full disclosure though, I do and almost always have been able to maintain one close relationship at a time, I cant say Ive ever truly been friendless so I can only imagine what that is really like.I personally dont think there is a point. Most of the time Im okay with that. Sometimes I think about how short a human lifetime is and it does feel like there isnt much difference between dying now and dying later. Life can feel futile. However, and this could be because I am a bit focused upon myself in general, I find myself living for good experiences. I dont really mean the grand experiences people talk about; the epic trips to strange places, the epiphanies, and so on. Just the good times. Doing things I genuinely like. Of course, when people are Depression, it can be really difficult to really enjoy things. I think it would be disingenuous if I declared that this is something that should or would work in your own life. My overall point is that there are other things that some people do live for, not just the mainstream ideals that we grow up thinking we need to strive for. I cant say if you will find your own point to life.I do hope you can feel better. I hope your next therapist is a better fit or results in some kind of relief.  I think your concern is founded but I dont think you should carry guilt for this. The what ifs of the past dont have to be the what ifs of the present. Keep anything youve learned but try to let the event itself go. I looked through some of your history. Would you consider telling your doctor that you feel Suicidal?Youre in a lot of immediate Pain right now but it looks like youve made it through some pretty difficult times before. Remember that some of the Pain will pass. Not fitting some sexual norms doesnt make you a freak. Youre attracted to your sister and thats that. I cant comment on what that means because its a little out of my depth, to be honest, and I also think its up to you and your sister to define what that means. Its okay if they dont work for you, many things didnt work for me. Some things were more like stepping stones for me. If things have been spiraling downwards, they can spiral upwards again too. Youre having a really hard time right now. I know it might seem hopeless and impossible to get out of, but thats the Depression wearing you down. Keep talking to people who will listen. I think its important for you to tell him you love him. I dont know if that will help with the guilt or if it will help your familys situation but I think it might be important for you (and maybe your step-dad) in the future.Consider showing him what youve typed here if you cant tell him.(Dont worry about being in the wrong sub-reddit.)  Please call the emergency service number for your area. Hold something over the cuts tightly, as tight as you can. Even if you think the cuts will stop Bleeding on their own, please call anyway. Its okay if it wasnt a suicide attempt or not, the details arent as important as getting the Bleeding stopped. Please make that call. Whats happening? Youre welcome, come back anytime. Contact a lawyer if you have phone privileges. If you dont, have someone else contact a lawyer for you. Hi. If these Hallucinations are generally happening when you are sleepy, waking, or going to sleep, please consider talking to your doctor about doing a sleep study. I think its also important to note that Modafinil, a drug to combat the effects of sleepiness, has helped to an extent.You can also talk to your doctor about \"reality checking\" methods to help you distinguish between what is actually happening and what youre experiencing.Also consider that antipsychotics are often used off-label. While your doctor may have prescribed them for your Hallucinations, dont take that as a diagnosis, just as a diagnostic tool. (I do understand the reluctance to take resperidone because I wont take it again for the same reasons.) /r/suicidology  I dont think Delusional disorder factors into it. A lawyer is most qualified to advise the OP on the situation. I hope the OP gets any help they need, legally and medically. Make sure you read the disclaimers for the hotline/chat. Some will report, some wont.It sucks to have the police show up, but dont let that scare you away from getting some help. Youre not doing anything wrong. It can be heart wrenching to reach out and have no response. That isnt a reflection upon you. I know you feel that you are nothing, and while it may not alleviate that feeling, I dont think you are. Youre a person who absolutely has thoughts and feelings. That is something, even if it feels horrible. I personally think that the ability to experience is something that gives us all value, every living thing. I have to suspect that that may not make you feel better. I wish I could better illustrate the idea or to somehow demonstrate your intrinsic (in my opinion) value.I also wish I could say something to give you hope, something to soothe your Pain. I dont know that I can. I know that wishes dont accomplish things on their own, but I hope that my wishes for you can maybe demonstrate that you do have worth. I dont think that value and worth are determined by others. While I believe you are valuable, its not my place to assign that value to you. You already have it just by being. When Im being honest, I feel a similar way. In my mind, it is how I will die. I dont know if thats conditioning from feeling Suicidal or a result of mental Illness or practicality or whatever. It does feel like a pointless wheel, seemingly endless cycles and then the wheel comes off the spoke and its over. However, I want to think that it doesnt necessarily matter if we do kill ourselves in the future. As hard as it is for me to personally to see it otherwise, we dont live in the future, it hasnt happened yet. Getting through the feeling now can seem futile and pointless but I try to consider how I feel when I do get through that feeling. I dont feel that way when Im out of it. I cant say which is \"real\" or not.Im not sure if that made sense. I personally dont find \"live in the moment\" comforting but I also dont want to be ruled by things that havent occurred, no matter how likely I feel they may be. Please consider the mistakes we may make as building blocks or bricks. Each mistake we make is another block to build with. We accumulate blocks. We can use those blocks to build a wall or we can use them to build stairs. If we build stairs, we wouldnt learn as much and our stairs wouldnt get as high, without those mistakes. We can use our mistakes to grow and to learn.  Its often tempting to build a wall instead, or to let the blocks accumulate into a huge pile. (Its even okay to do so because that pile or that wall can still be torn down and the blocks within can be used for stairs.) I apologize for the metaphor but it really helps me gather what I want to say. I also want to note that our stairs, our walls, or our piles of bricks arent what define our lives. Our mistakes or what we think of as mistakes dont make up our whole person. Were also not defined, I think, by how our mistakes compare with others. Youre not a waste, youre not a bad person. Youre still growing and we all are always growing, even a little. I feel the same way about my cats. I Tired much wish right now that I had some kind of solution. I am also Disability and if I were suddenly alone, I wouldnt be homeless, but I would no longer be able to support my cats. I feel that it would be the end of my life as well.I tend to think there must always be some other option. I wish I knew what that was. Would your ex take the cats without your death? I know that probably isnt much better but it could be a chance for you to figure something out about how to keep them, if you could get them back. My heart really goes out to you. If you do ever find another therapist, print this out and give it to them. I wish I could express what things are like as well as this. Im sorry your life has been like this. Youre welcome, I hope someone can come up with some practical advice. I hope you make it through these times. Ive been that friend. Lots of lies and avoidance and guilt and shame. It tough to say what will convince your friend she needs help. All you can really do is try to be understanding, keep putting yourself out there as her friend. Try something out of the norm like sending a letter explaining that you miss her. I would try to keep the advice and suggestions at a minimum at first. Sometimes people just want to be heard by their friends, having solutions pushed to the forefront can be pretty overwhelming.Its more than okay to be angry about your friend lying. If possible, try not to let that color future interactions. I cant speak for your friend and cant know why she lied but I know that for me, it felt like a necessity. We sometimes do unfortunate things when it feels like a matter of survival.The biggest thing to remember, and I think the toughest, is that you can lead a horse to water but you cant make her drink.It sounds like youre being a good friend by not giving up on her and wanting her to have help. Ive had friends like you, and not to make this about me, but I Pain sometimes thinking about how I couldnt return that friendship. I hope things work out, I truly do. I think it really depends on the individual and the environment. Talking to some people can make things worse, talking to other people can make things better. In regards to judgement, Ive found it a lot easier to talk about my problems with strangers. I can always end contact with someone not in my life or on the internet. Sometimes, being Depression doesnt hinge on how good our lives might be. I dont think you sound like youre being dramatic. Its extremely frustrating to not be able to pull yourself out of feeling this way. I dont know what your situation is like at home but please keep trying with your parents. Something to try might be to write down what your day is like. Write down what you do and how you feel. Show that to them. There may also be someone you can talk to at your school.Its hard to see any point to life when feeling as you do. I wish I could answer your question but its something we all must answer for ourselves. Please keep talking to people, keep trying, its the only way to find the answer for yourself. I hope you feel better. I just wanted to say that I dont think there really is a \"too nice.\" Being nice might be a hindrance in some areas of life, you might have more trouble with some things, but kindness is, I think, the most beautiful thing about any human being. Being kind is something that Ive struggled with, personally. I have had some Tired unkind periods of my life that I feel some regret about. Hang onto your niceness, try to see it as an investment in your future. As you grow, it could become a great asset. I understand. I think everything is or becomes colored by whatever feelings drive this kind of thinking. I know that when I am thinking about suicide or in a deep Depression, there is no other option. It seems right and it seems as if it will happen, not a matter of if or when. I cant say this is how it is or will be for you but in my own experience its a matter of making it through those times. Making it until, for whatever unexplainable reason, I can think about other things and other options. I dislike saying, \"youre young, give it time,\" especially since I cant say you will experience things the way I have. So its with hesitation that I say to keep giving it time. Time is a resource we all have, even if it can be unbearable to pass.I absolutely wish I could tell you something tangible or useful. I think whatever you ultimately choose, you deserve respect and understanding. I hope that if you choose to continue that youll feel free to keep talking here or to come back at a later date. I hear you on that one hundred percent. I havent used any hotlines before because Im actually afraid of the same thing, but I hope someone can come along with some suggestions about good ones. I consider humiliation to be one of the strongest feelings throughout my life. For me, humiliation takes on a life of its own. I know that it might not matter what people think but that doesnt change the effect that humiliation has on me. I dont really know what to do either, aside from avoiding situations where I know or suspect Ill feel humiliated. I dont know if that can be \"cured.\"Ive done a lot of things to try to work around it. Some negative, some positive. I dont really know what you should do. There are a lot of people hidden in this world with similar feelings and experiences. I hope you find something helpful. Statistics are a funny thing because they always reflect the view of the statistician. I cant really tell you not to dwell on your height, I know what its like \n",

      "- Talking is good. Ive been reading your comments here, they seem pretty helpful :) Sorry youre still having a rough time. Im glad the meds are helping a bit though. And your therapist is right I think, thoughts are just thoughts. Maybe you cant prevent them from coming into your head, but you can work on ignoring them and not giving them the attention they want. This is kind of what mindfulness targets.Stay safe. I Hyperactive behavior your positive paragraph, glad you can see some good :). Id eat some ice cream if I were you.   Is there anyone in your life you can trust and talk to? Sorry for the late reply.  Thank you!  Sorry. I get what you Irritable Mood by being a burden. I feel the same way. Im sure your friends have reassured you that youre not though. It takes time to get over someone and move on. But you have to give yourself the chance.  Yeah. Its hard. What do you do? I just sleep. Ive been so bored today... I dont have anything to work on or any hobbies or anything Hyperactive behavior that. Cutting would help to fill the boredom. Oh well.  Hey. Thanks for the reply. Im sure they would but Im too scared, I guess I want someone I know. Ill probably call one day... thanks again.  Please eat. Ive done this a few times (not for nearly as long). Not eating is only going to make you feel worse. Have something small, or go out for food. I dont know.Sorry about all the duplicate comments haha... I dont know how that happened.  Happens here too. Sometimes I want to slash myself up but I never do more than a few cuts. I guess its a good thing. Im too scared.  Well I guess Im glad you have to put it off. Please seek help in the meantime. Im sorry I was unhelpful.  Oh. Try to put it off for as long as you can. And good luck with school. Why are you staying so late?  I hope you get one. What kind of job are you looking for?  How about you go and find out? You dont need to tell them youre suicidal unless you want to. If you know it isnt youre Anxiety Mental Depression causing this stuff, tell them that. Help them narrow down what it could be. It seems you want help with your physical health first, because thats what is causing all the rest, and thats fine. You can go to the hospital. Tell them the truth, and get medical help. Maybe they will put you on antidepressants, but they wont ignore your physical ailments. You dont need to be afraid. Im glad youre willing to go to the hospital. Its a good step.  Good luck.  You know, its a good thing youre bad at that. It hurts to have yet another failure, I understand that. But Im glad youre still around. Whats going on? If you want to just chat, Ill talk with you.  This is a pretty good explanation. I always imagine more cuts will give me a better release but by the time I do it, a few is enough.  I dont mind (unless you somehow know me...). Its programming/software development.  No not long at all. Can you talk to your parents about things? Why is she kicking you out after youve helped so much. Sorry things are going poorly. Please eat! What program are you in? Im assuming youre in university/college.  Nice. I would go for a walk, but theyre so boring alone. I should at least give it a shot.  Wow. I think she overstepped her bounds. Having hardly met you... its alright to tell her shes pressuring you. If she really wants to help she should respect that. Im sorry this happened, sounds rough. Let her keep tabs on you, but be honest and tell her youre feeling pressured.  Please dont friend. Well you may have already done it by now... but I hope not. :( I dont know what to tell you. Getting drunk isnt that great.  Thank you! Im glad youre giving it a shot. Mention how youre feeling please. Theyll give you priority! Im not sure. I dont really understand how everyone feels so good after. I guess I mostly feel relieved. Like exhaling a really deep breath. So I Irritable Mood, it feels good. But not Hyperactive behavior a high.  Good luck! Let us know how it goes!  Hey thanks. I hope I did... but I spent no time studying. Why? Because Im an idiot with horrible priorities. And my backlog of homework was too much.  Hey. Pretty much feel the exact same way as you (with the Tylenol and such). Please reach out to someone. Even just a friend. Thats what I did. I hope youre alright.   I dont think talking about getting over that would even be allowed here. Youre right its possible. But that instinct exists for a reason. I want to kill myself too. My family and my friends missing me has no impact on that for me either.But anyway... Im glad youre still here. It would suck to be forced into therapy, and thats avoidable by either willingly going, or finding another support. What do you Irritable Mood by lying to yourself about lifes problems? Whats gotten you to this point? Im glad you have hope things might change, thats important. Please keep that hope.  Thats good, Im glad to hear back from you.   :s its hard. I dont get it at all. Im doing so much better than a few weeks ago. But I still want to cut. I even dream about it. Its so sucky. I hope youre alright.   Im sorry. That sucks and sounds Hyperactive behavior a hard situation. Heres the thing: they dont want you gone. Their threat of military school sounds Hyperactive behavior (a really poor attempt) at helping you out. They dont want you gone from the planet, I know that. Im sorry they would preach to you. Maybe you could just mention that you need REAL help, and not from them necessarily but youd appreciate them helping you find it. Military school doesnt sound Hyperactive behavior a good solution, but there are things that can help. I selfharm too, its stupid and sucky and I keep it from my parents. But when youre on the edge you need to try everything first. I dont know. I dont know what you should say to your parents that would help YOU the most. But there has to be something. Maybe for tonight you could just go to the emergency room and say how youre feeling. I dont know if thats possible for you but its an alternative to telling your parents and its a way better option than killing yourself. Please hang in there. No one will be better with you gone. I know how youre feeling, I feel the same way often. But I know deep down its not true. It cant possibly be true. I hope you know that too.  Thanks. I took it throughout school so Id say I know a bunch. Not well enough to speak it (mostly not confident). Anyway, Ill pm you for sure. Today was much better. And it isnt so much being in France, except for the lack of support I suppose.  Sorry, see my other comment. I make sure theyre clean and such. I just dont see the point in doing anything extra.  Its been removed or deleted. But the commenters all said you werent ugly. Im sure theyre right. And the counsellors arent there just to make money. Otherwise why would I be talking to you know. Im not getting paid :) People care.  Hey thanks for the reply. I understand that, but how does my brain know to jump to Depressed mood itself to feel better. I dont even know, my question doesnt make much sense to even me. Basically boils down to WHHHYY Hey, I saw your comment on the other post. Im sorry things are so bad for you right now. What if you just try telling your parents about your struggles? You dont need to lay it all out at once, but please make an attempt. If its too hard to say maybe write it down or email them or something. I know they expect a lot of you, but theyd rather you not meet those expectations than be dead. I also think youre being much harder on yourself than theyd ever be. But youll never know if you dont try talking. Please give it another day. Or even just first make an attempt at letting your parents know. I know it wont make things better. But you have nothing to lose at this point, trying to get help (even by making this post) is worth a shot. I hope youre alright OP.  Why dont you truly need help.  What kind of person does that? Im sorry youve relapsed. Recovery is a long process though. You didnt ruin anything, youre still recovering. Slip ups are part of that. Its alright, just get up again and keep going.  Thank you.  Hey, same thing happens to me. I dont get why people would be my friend, so I ask. Or dont talk to them for a long time. Then they get Anger :( then I think \"we really shouldnt be friends, Im awful\". I dont know the solution. I have no one to talk to either and I feel sad as well. Its good you dont think youll kill yourself, but the thoughts are pretty scary. Sucks man.  Awesome Im glad things went well! And no problem.   Well, Ill tell you this: youre not a burden. Even if you were, people would prefer you to be alive than dead. Theres nothing you could do where the appropriate response (as punishment or whatever) would be to kill yourself. Im sorry things arent working out right now. Anything specific? Why do you feel Hyperactive behavior a burden exactly? By the way, I feel Hyperactive behavior a burden too. But feelings arent facts.  Sounds Hyperactive behavior fun. I hope things are looking up from this morning.  Congrats sj. Good luck! What degree this time?  Hey, whats going on? Asking stuff Hyperactive behavior this is against the rules. If you really want to know you can find out other places. But I highly recommend against it. Its a bad habit to start and really hard to stop. Please talk to someone about it instead of doing it. That usually helps me. Cutting doesnt solve anything. It makes things worse.  Exactly. Hard not to talk about it when its on my mind nearly always. Thank you.   Im from Canada.  Im so glad. Thank you for making the call, great job.  That really sucks. Im sorry, youre not worthless though. And if you really werent worth her time: thats on her, not you. Theres nothing wrong with you. Do you have any hobbies?  Hey man. I have spotty coverage right now so I probably wont be able to reply for awhile. Help is coming, please stick around. I know you said you dont have anybody, but please try to reach out. Go to the doctor or hospital. Theyll find you help. From there you can piece things together and get to a point where you want to live. If youre sure about your decision, at least before you go, could you give a little more details about your situation? Just to chat. Im sure others will comment here soon too. Well Ive been eating a lot of chocolate if that counts. I dont know. It is something to be wary of, you dont want to replace one bad habit with another.  Like I said, it takes time. Maybe even a long time. Dont beat yourself up. Im sorry she moved on so fast. Dont let her actions decide whether youre loved or wanted. Things didnt work out with her, but you are still loved. You are still wanted. And the time you spent with her wasnt a waste. It isnt fair I agree, its hard and stupid. But you can do it. Youve made it from January to now, you can keep going.  Well... seems Hyperactive behavior a bad meal if you ask me. Whats up? Whats gotten you to this point?  Nice, sounds fun! Good luck with it all. Whats school psychology?  Hey, I have a similar thing. I imagine things that I want to create by painting or drawing or whatever. But Im horrible at all art... I have the ideas but not the skill (or patience to learn). You can still create things though! I enjoy programming and try to use that to build/contribute what I Hyperactive behavior to pretend is art. Anyway, theres probably something Hyperactive behavior that for you too. I dont have any advice sadly, but theres no such thing as a worthwhile life. (in the sense that some are more valuable or worth more than others.) whatever you do or can do is enough.  Oh. Thats what I thought :/ caring for them Hyperactive behavior that though is too expensive/hard. Especially if they hardly bleed.  Yeah, I know what you Irritable Mood. I told a friend awhile back that I wish she could see herself how I saw her. And that I wish I could see myself how everyone else saw me. It sucks that its much easier to see the good in others, but I guess it shows youre caring. I know its hard, but looking out for yourself is really important. How many do you have? What are Hyperactive behavior to have as pets? And honestly, that sounds Hyperactive behavior a good reason not to kill yourself. Stick around for their sake, and keep trying with everything else. I dont have any pets but from what I hear they make good companions. They need you, and you probably need them. Are you getting any help with how youre feeling? Have you talked to anyone (besides the internet)? 2 years ago I decided the same thing. No idea why I chose 25... no strings attached either, I Im almost certain Ill end up killing myself by then. I also feel fine right now, I dont know. Ill probably never mention it to any professional myself. It would probably be a good idea to though. So I suppose the same applies for you. I Hyperactive behavior what /u/ruthluss said, its an unresolved issue even though youre feeling okay right now. I know for me its unresolved. I dont have any advice sadly, but I think I know exactly how you feel. I hope I dont kill myself before 25, but as happy as I am right now I cant imagine living more than 5 years more. I just dont want to.  Im sorry. I hope youre still around, please keep trying. Make one last attempt at getting help. Everyone has treated you very poorly, thats not your fault. You dont need to die because of how youve been treated.  Hey, hows it going? I saw you posting to help others out, great job. When is your appointment? Im sorry youre having such a hard time, but Ive noticed you can see the good in small things. Which is helpful. Yeah getting better immediately wont happen, but you are strong enough to get better slowly. Im glad you have your family to keep you here. I know you wish you could just die, but sticking around is a good thing, and you have a good reason to: a family that loves and needs you.  Youre going through a rough time. But I know you can push through it! Im sorry you lost her. Have you talked since? You are not nothing. You were important and valuable before you met her. You are after shes gone.  Oh man. Im so sorry :( 19 days sounds dangerous... whether you talk to your parents or someone else, please get help. Im sorry your mom is kicking you out. Im sure if she knew your condition (and the fact youre starving yourself) shed reconsider.  Im here for a year for an internship. Are you in France?  So... why are you doing this? What would get you to eat? Dont you think 5 days is long enough? Wow. Same here. Its just an impossible cycle. I get up motivation to do something, then I cant because its too overwhelming. So I hate myself for failing. Then I hate myself more for not trying etc.  You seem likeable to me. I know youre not crazy, and Im sorry they tried to lock you up. I dont know what to suggest to you... Im really sorry everything is going how it is for you. Why not try writing something now? Doesnt need to be big or major. I dont know. Im sorry  Its alright. Thanks for the reply. Im feeling pretty good right now so Im not going to address what you said really... but Im the only one pressuring me. Thanks again.  Hey. Its alright, Im doing a bit better now.  Against the rules. What about parents or friends? The school counsellor? Im sorry you dont have anyone to talk to. Whats gotten you wanting to cut?  :( feel the same way. I do it to bleed and for the scars. I dont even do it when Im upset anymore. I wish I understood. Why do you want to feel pain? Im not exactly trying to stop... I think it just makes me ugly/worthless so Im trying to avoid it. Wanting to do it and trying not to is so upsetting though... Thats all Ive done today, avoided cutting. I wish the day was over already. I wish I was asleep. I have too many wishes.   Last time you posted here you said it was helpful. I hope posting again can be just as helpful. Whats going on? Edit: everything you said in this post about the rest of us applies to you too! I read through your post history, you gave others helpful advice. You told them the reasons they have to live and how much theyre worth. All of these things apply to you as well. I saw you have pet rats, whats that Hyperactive behavior? Sounds Hyperactive behavior a fun pet to have.  Hi. Call 911 or something equivalent. Or get yourself to the hospital. You clearly dont want to do this, please take the steps to help yourself. I hope youre alright.  If youre confused, reaching out here was a good decision. And people here are here to help you out. What did you take? I hope its not fatal. Would probably be Elevated mood to talk about things in the meantime anyway. So, whats up? Sorry. I guess I didnt explain well. I dont know. Im too lazy to or I feel Hyperactive behavior it doesnt really deserve/need any attention besides making sure it isnt bleeding. Bandaids work fine.  Hi welcome back. Honestly youre not ugly at all... Thats the 100% truth. You could find a girlfriend who looked Hyperactive behavior whatever you wanted. But its probably more important to find someone you Hyperactive behavior. Being confident would help, because heres another truth: you arent talentless. You deserve to see yourself better. I hope you can. Theres nothing wrong with you, and your English is great. Im sorry you feel so bad. I dont know what else to say. Im not lying to make you feel better. Im telling you the full truth because you need to hear it. You look fine. You are talented. And youre valuable.  Hey, good luck! Whats it on? For me, as long as I feel good going into the test Im alright with whatever grade. Being prepared helps but so does attitude. Be confident! And good luck studying.  I dont know. Not really. And no, I cant really speak it at all. Not from Quebec (I wish I was). Part of why I came here was to learn French. Thanks for the replies, Im heading to bed now.  No its not a fun way to live at all. But hey, keep banging on the wall! I dont know, giving up seems so easy and Hyperactive behavior the better choice right now. But fighting issue the brave, strong choice. And I knows youre strong enough to. So please keep at it. Youve been well before Im sure. You can be well again. I dont want to say \"theres no point in killing yourself\" because it sounds Irritable Mood. And Id hate to hear it. But really, pushing on CAN be so much more rewarding. I dont know if it will be. I dont know if it will be for myself... but how about we find out? Hey, Im so glad to hear this. I hope things went well! Good luck.  What does gaping Irritable Mood exactly?  You deleted that post, but from the comments I can see youre not ugly. I dont want to give you life advice and say be confident, because thats easier said than done. Your issue isnt being ugly though. Please reach out and get some help. Have you seen someone for your Anxiety Mental Depression and Mental Depression?  They can theoretically. But they wont. Its alright though, dont worry. Not to talk about OP behind her/his back butIm sure they called (if they didnt they would have just stopped posting).I hope youre alright Kayce. Get back to use when you can.    Hello /u/addicted7, I was just thinking about you earlier this week. Sucks about the cutting :( have things been better for you though? I Irritable Mood since your last post on reddit, things seemed pretty rough. Stay safe please, and dont stop getting help. Being afraid of getting locked up is reasonable, but you have to look out for yourself. And do whats best for you (which sadly might be against what you want). Anyway, good luck.  I know exactly what you Irritable Mood... Ive been late a lot the past two weeks. I feel Hyperactive behavior cutting while at school so often, but I always try to just put it off until Im home. Which helps me Sedated state down a bit by giving it time.  Doesnt sound dumb at all. I think that every weekend. I dont really have advice. What helps me is having someone to force me to get things done. I dont literally force... but you know, someone who makes sure I get it done. And helps me along the way with reminders or whatever. Try breaking things down into smaller, manageable problems. Finally, dont kill yourself if you dont finish your homework. I hope that doesnt sound too harsh, because I dont Irritable Mood it to be. Really whats the worst thing that could happen if you didnt finish your work? I am 100% sure it isnt as bad as dying. The other persons comment is probably more helpful. I guess my main point is I can relate. But I know you can continue through this Ache. Feeling Hyperactive behavior this no matter what your reason is fine, theres not a list of good reasons and bad reasons. It sucks you feel Hyperactive behavior this, and I hope you feel better. Are you getting any professional help?  I didnt exactly have any realisations sadly. Just went to the hospital for a few days and at least for now Im feeling better. It would text you but last time I did that I wasted $30. PM me and Ill send you my email.  Oh man. I took a class on that last semester and dropped it because... well I blame the prof. I actually just finished one on compiler construction :s I hope I did well, Hyperactive behavior I said I was confident going in. My next one on Wednesday.  I feel the exact same way man. I dont know what to tell you. This life is much too hard and unfair. Literally all we can do is suck it up and continue. I dont know why. Youre not as bad as you think, I promise you that. Im sorry you feel Hyperactive behavior this. /u/cameroncac is right, you (and myself as well) have to push through. :(  Good plan with programming. Python and C are my favourite languages. My next one is Tuesday :/ Hey, how did the test go? Im sure you did great Hey... please stick around. Youve been fighting so hard. You CAN keep doing that. I believe in you. Talk to someone before you do anything. Im sorry.  Hey Emily, whats up? Im sorry things have been so hard. Im glad you posted though and I hope the people here can help. Whats on your mind? Youre not a joke to me.  Why? Im sure you could get something set up even for today. Youre in college, they probably have free walkin counselling services there. That would be a good start.  Dont be so hard on yourself please. Like I said, theres nothing wrong with you. I dont know why she broke up with you, but thats her mistake. You can continue life and pick things back up again even without her. When did you drop out? Software Engineering then two more compsci ones. I Hyperactive behavior programming. Im good at it. But this semester is going horribly wrong. I wish I could stop my downward spiral.  No problem, keep at it!  You know your grade already? Sorry :( hope you still pass the course.  Thank you for the reply. Youre right about things, its just I really dont know what the issue is. I cant deal with life. And when the smallest thing goes wrong I let it really upset me. Its usually school related things, I feel Hyperactive behavior a failure for not completing what I know I can.  I dont know why I do. I guess to cope, it helps me Sedated state down when Im feeling overwhelmed (which was pretty much always until recently). I also do it to feel in control, because when I do it, no one else can stop me and I guess feeling powerful over myself is comforting. And I sort of see it as a minisuicide. I cant kill myself but at least I can Chest Pain myself. Also I kind of Hyperactive behavior how it looks.  Hey, sorry. I didnt Irritable Mood it Hyperactive behavior that. All I was trying to say was how you see yourself might not be true. All those things you listed are facts. I really didnt Irritable Mood to sound rude or presumptuous. You dont need to say anything nice, its fine.  Yeah. It sucks, hope youre doing alright.  Please call. If you cant do it, maybe someone here can for you (not sure if thats allowed...). Or text someone you know and ask them to call. Please. Im sorry this is so hard.  No its fine. I talked with her. I know she doesnt view me poorly or anything. I just dont want to Anxiety her or upset her but thats all I can manage doing with pretty much anyone. I wish she never saw is all. I dont mind her knowing because shes nice about it, but her seeing the razors made it more real. Thanks for the reply.  Yes. I dont understand it at all. Be safe.  I read your other submissions. I dont know why people downvoted them and disliked them. I thought they were interesting and well written. Maybe you should start a blog, just post what youre thinking where no one can downvote it. I thought your posts about MW3 and Zelda-CDi were great by the way. I 100% agree with what you said. Yeah Zelda-CDi has been talked to death, but its still fun to mock! I suck at MW3 and its so frustrating because when playing you dont get much time to get better before dying. I still love it though (best CoD game IMO). Also your post about the Easter flame thing was pretty informative, Ive never heard about it before. I dont think its ever been posted on /r/christianity even, Ive been going there daily for the past 3 years. Anyway, talk about your problems to a counsellor. Be honest because it really helps. I care about your dumb history facts and your life. Im sorry you feel ashamed :( I hope you feel better soon. Youre not failing at everything.  Hi. Ive been reading your posts and Im so glad youre getting help and were able to be honest with your husband. Its great he is so supportive, I hope things go well. You can do this, just take it one step at a time.  Woah, that sucks. Please go back! Easy job to get if your boss really liked you. I hope you can do it.  :( that sucks. What about tomorrow? Do you think you could hold out for one more day? And give getting help a chance. Please.  Good insight, I see what you Irritable Mood with our subconscious knowing it will produce an endorphin rush. Thanks for the long reply, I appreciate it. Wonder if theres been any research into this kind of explanation. Ill try to dig something up. Thank you again! Heres my thoughts: some of the more complicated or longer posts here never get replies because people arent sure what to say. Honestly Im usually too lazy to type out what Im thinking... if I could talk with people here Id say a lot more. Anyway...Im sorry people have ignored your posts. I care that you Chest Pain yourself. And I appreciate you giving people advice. I dont know what to say, and I think thats the main thing. People dont know what to say. Some things are easier in person. Stay safe. I hope writing this post helped you out a bit. I know ranting helps me.  Hey. I feel similar. I dont know. It doesnt make sense. Maybe its life even-ing up the cards. I really dont know. Its stupid and messed up and sucks. I dont have any advice, but dont trivialise how youre feeling. Even if you think you have no reason. Who cares? I dont think Suicide or selfharm is ever really reasonable. One doesnt need a reason to be depressed. Its not a choice and just happens. Im sorry if this isnt helpful. Random thoughts.  Yeah seems Hyperactive behavior a Suicide note... I hope he didnt go through with it and you get in contact with him. Im sorry.  Whats up? Anything you want to talk about? Im sorry youre at this point, and I cant imagine the Ache youre in.  Well throwing up is probably a good thing. You need to get help though, please call 911. You can do it, and it will help. I know its scary and you dont want to go, but Hyperactive behavior the other person said, you posted here for a reason. You want to stick around. I want you to. Please call.  Hi. Im glad you posted here. How did your appointment with the T go? Take a deep breath. Its alright. Youre almost to your appointment! Youre doing great getting this far. It doesnt make you a pansy to be afraid to kill yourself. It makes you brave. Fighting through when everything screams for you to do it is very brave and courageous. Im glad youre bad at killing yourself :) you wouldnt be around talking to me if you werent. Im sorry, please keep trying. Take it a day at a time. Or an hour. You can do it. Its alright to be nervous, I completely understand. But you can fight through that. I know you can. \n",

      "- Thank you very much for the picture. I printed it out the second I saw it.  You put a big smile on my face. Thank you again.p.s.-damn you drew that? My girlfriend of 7 years recently broke up with me. We also have a 2 year old son. So, I went to Mexico for a family reunion deal (she was offered a free trip and declined). Went there the day after valentines day. I thought we would spend some time together before I left. Boy was I wrong. Instead I went to a bar with my buddy and we each got a pitcher of blue moon and drowned our sorrows. My entire time in Mexico I missed her and my son to the point of craziness. I was more than excited to come home.Anyway, I have her pick me up from the airport when I get back. I havent spoken to her in almost a week (no cell service) and I lit up when I saw that she brought our son. I was on top of the world for those few minutes. I get into her car and see a little flower sitting in a coke can in her cup holder. Im Hyperactive behavior \"what the ef?\" and I ask her if she needs to tell me something. While I was gone, she got a new boyfriend. Now, we have been having a rough spot for the last couple weeks and had no idea it was this bad. Normally we talk to each other about it. Nope. Needless to say, I was destroyed mentally and physically. Its been about a week and a half and I still cant get over it. Especially since we have a kid and have to have contact with one another.Im bi-polar and schizo-affective, so my mind is obviously going beserk. Ive had problems with suicidal thoughts in the past but now its worse than ever. I Irritable Mood, I cant even talk to her about it. Shes been the Seizures, Focal point in my life for 7 years and now I have to cut it out? Ive been thinking about letting this all out for a while. Its scary because I know that if we didnt have our son, I would probably be dead by now. Which sucks, because I rule. Its a constant struggle within myself. My happy go-lucky personality is being bombarded by bad bad thoughts.Its Hyperactive behavior this...normally Im Hyperactive behavior the Night Owl. But now, I feel more Hyperactive behavior The Comedian. Not giving a shit and wanting everyone to pay (odd reference ahah). +1 to Moore for that masterpiece, I just finished reading it and it really made me feel better for some reason. I also stared at this picture for about 10 minutes yesterday and almost started bawling http://img.phombo.com/img1/photocombo/131/cache/el_pez_by_allanced_display.jpgThanks for listening guys. I know how you feel man. My ex and I were together for 7 years, have a 2 1/2 yo son and she was also my best friend. I too dont have many (if any) real friends to rely on.  She became my world and I always thought wed be together forever and be a family. She started seeing someone else when I was in Mexico for a family reunion in February and it tore me up.I did the same self-medicating: weed, Attention Deficit Disorder meds, my vicodin. It helped make me happy and it was all I needed. I know exactly how you feel man. The oxy is scary stuff. If you are gonna take it, break it up into pieces (especially if its an 80). 20mg of oxy is 4 percoset 5mg.  Be careful man, were all here for ya if you need people to talk to. Try 7 years and a kid bub. It sucks when things Hyperactive behavior pop up unexpected. It feels Hyperactive behavior your heart is being torn out and stomped on. Relish in the glory of Reddit and let it free your mind. Ive found that there are a lot of genuinely caring folks here who have more than enough time to help one another out. Greatest community ever. now youre putting the pussy on a pedestal haha. youre right though for the most part. Thats good to know. Im only familiar with vicodin and percocet. Ive done oxy 3 times and it was not fun.  I think one of the hardest things about this is feeling alone.  I just want to be able to hear that someone loves me (not just family).  Especially with my bi-polar and schizo-ness I dwell on things Hyperactive behavior that and get really really depressed.  I just hate the thought of being alone; even though I have my son and family, not having her to talk to at night kills me. And having to forget all of those happy memories is something I dont want to do but Ill end up having to if I want to move on.  Right now is the hardest part of my life...yet. Dont use that book as your basis of your understanding of us guys.  Most of the time guys that Hyperactive behavior want you to come up to them and take charge. It may sound weird but its the truth. Try asking him out to do something just the two of you and see what happens. Thank you.  I actually am not on any medication.  I was on Zyprexa and then Seroquel for quite a while but stopped taking the anti-psychotics about a year ago.  Funny how both of those drugs are off the market now for fucking people up.  But it worked for me.Anyway, Ive been thinking about seeing my shrink for a while.  Maybe get back on the anti-depressants or something.  Thank you though for the thoughtful post.  It actually means a lot to me since I dont have many friends. My girlfriend of 7 years recently broke up with me.  We also have a 2 year old son.

      "- It can be hard to appreciate the notion that you could meet someone else who will make you happy when you are so deeply in love with your boyfriend. Your desires are set on him and not much else will make you happy at the moment. But over time the mind has a way of dealing with loss, this is a proven fact in psychology. Over time, one day you will arrive at a level where you again feel at peace and can start feeling comfortable at looking into new relationships.It is certainly uncomfortable dealing with your current situation but do understand that with some time and patience the Pain will go away and you will get through the difficulties that many US students are encountering with debt, unemployment and undervalued degrees.These are problems that many of us are facing right now, you are not alone. It is crushing to face all these difficulties at the same time, but getting through them is what is going to make us stronger, smarter and more emotionally aware than any generation that came before us.  The voice is just a voice. People can praise you, people can hate you but it doesnt change who you are. Think about it. People can come up to you and say you are awesome, but does that change you in any way? No. It is a psychological thing.Think about how absurd it is what you are saying here. A little voice is telling you to kill yourself, so youre actually going to do it?If I went up to a random person and told them to kill themselves, they would probably walk away from me.You should persevere. You do so by not identifying with it. It might always be there, negative feelings and thoughts always present themselves to us when we are vulnerable. But a voice is just a voice, it is not us, and we only suffer under its rule when we allow it an ear.This happens to everyone, it is just a matter of depth. Suicidal people have invested a lot of energy into \"I\" thoughts, such as \"I am worthless, I am miserable\". And you breathe life right into them by doing that, and they come back to sap more life. Let them starve!Any insult against you is worthless unless you give it credit. It is like a cheque that bounces at the bank.So dont give into your negative thoughts and feelings. Stop giving them credit. This is hard in the beginning, and hard over time, but you know you can actually be content and live a decent life if you take this seriously. Stop giving the \"I\" so much credit. You indeed sound Tired bipolar. Bipolar is when you take things to such extremes. It is a terrible illness. I suffered it myself at one point, and have taken lithium and a variety of other medications to deal with it. Its not so bad. It helps. But ultimately the problem is a psychological one. Youre going to have to feel your way around your body and understand your own psychological profile, your triggers and so forth.What is also Tired important to note that bipolarity is a two way street. You might have these extreme moments of aversion (the knife carving incident), but what people dont realize is that you also have your moment of desires, or what I mean by that is, you go way too far into the things you love.If you were just a bit more indifferent about things youd stabilize a great deal, I think, having had the illness. Obviously stop taking drugs and stuff like that if youre taking them, but also stop staying up so late, or doing whatever it is you do to an extreme. Live a balanced life. Bonus points if you find that life boring. Acclimate to that and make it your new norm, a stable life is a happy life. Live a stable life where you are relatively indifferent to most things, you will enjoy your accumulated efforts over the years and you will be pleased. Do NOT go into extremes of Pain and pleasure, which is essentially what you are doing. Leave well enough alone. You will always come back so much stronger afterwards. Ive been cheated on in at least one or two long term relationships, sometimes I dont know if the girl was faithful in one of the relationships, I digress... it is extremely painful, you will suffer for months on end but when you come out of it you will be better than you were before, hardened by fire. Then you will meet somebody worth your time. The person Im going out with now is the best person Ive ever gone out with by far... the experience will prove that you are worth someone who is loyal and awesome. You should never allow yourself the space to feel those feelings. They are not some sort of natural feeling as people say they are. Any sort of feeling that started back when you were a teenager aught to be called into question. We all have many stupid feelings as a teenager. The problem is when those follow you into adulthood.I know people who are over 26 years old and engaging in the exact same habits that they were since they were 13. I mean thats just sad. When are they going to grow up and move on? Why do people get stuck with such old sufferings?Life is Tired hard, it is a constant improv but there are different ways of looking at it. Not everything is \"bad\". Just because youre suffering doesnt mean you need to take it so deeply to heart. I mean come on, you have a family that loves you. I avoid a lot of problems because I try not to focus on myself so much. I think of what I can do for others. This might sound egotistical in itself but really you have to understand the notion behind it. When we think with our mind, we always become Tired miserable. We never become happy through the way we think. Nothing is ever perfect or good when our mind has a say in it.But when youre trying to help others, its through the heart. And it feels good to help them. It makes one happy.I always recommend in these difficult times that people stop placing so much importance on their mind. Never allow negative thoughts inside your mind. Protect yourself with positive emotion. If robbers were pounding on your door, would you open the door to them? No. But then Suicidal thoughts come, and they are just as bad as murderers and those who want to harm your wife and family. Why do you allow them space?It is Tired important for you to manage your mind. If you have difficultly conjuring positivity in your interior world, then you need to step back and question why that is? What is holding you back from being a happy person?Quite often you will find it is these \"old friends\", these thoughts you identify with so much and feel to be so real. Its almost like they understand you.Well you made them with your thoughts, they subsist on your energy that they gain from you eating your food. Its entirely personalized.That is why it is so difficult to stop identifying with the thoughts. But you have to realize, they are coming to you, so theyre not you. Theyre just thoughts. Youre in control. You dont need to feed into that destructive cycle. Force the negative thoughts out, constantly demand that they stay out. Cultivate positivity, love your wife and child, do things to make them happy. Absorb that in.Positivity drives the negative thoughts out. Negative thoughts when accepted destroy the positivity. Its a real dragon and tiger scenario, but you need to stick on the good side. Never give the enemy an inch. Theyll take a mile. Retire your old way of thinking. It is a failed way. It has done you no good. Open your mind up, embrace positivity. Have a revolution, insist on embracing life. Well all die, sooner or later but lets have a part in bringing happiness to this planet while we can. We need people like you to help us, to come and help others. You are strong, youve made it this far. But you made a mistake, you leave the door open to that old enemy. Close it, close it every time and bar it off. You are not that thought of suicide.  I was like you once, I was miserable and broken. Almost ended up with my life completely ruined, I lived way too dangerously and almost lost my freedom, ex long term girlfriend and everything I loved. I turned my life around, picked up the pieces and built a new life out of it. Now my life is exciting, I am talking to a beautiful new gal, am progressing well in my studies and everything is looking up. Do not identify with the down times in your life. It always seems like it will never get better but thats not true. Eventually good things do happen, but we all have to do our part too. Dont be so hard on yourself man. Ive lived on my own for only like five months and Im 27. It is extremely expensive to do that sort of thing nowadays. Back in the day, you used to be able to build a house out of logs and a guy your age could have 6 kids already. Nowadays many are lucky to buy a house by the time they are 50.Dont get all tied up in with this society. It will burn you out. It doesnt care about who you are inside, it just cares with what you can do. Mechanical labor.Be OK with taking some time for yourself. Stop dating for a while. Be OK with taking some time to relax. You are too wound up. You arent going to find happiness by \"doing things\". No matter how big the check list or how many things you check off, that does not necessarily mean you will have lived a Tired successful life.Instead, take some time to get to know yourself. When you lay down to have a nap, dont completely go to sleep, just rock back and forth a little bit to barely stay away, and just feel yourself in the bed, just be aware you are there and keep doing that over and over again. Feelings will come to you and thoughts will come to you but you will become more aware of them. Just really feel them and get to understand them.You can change how everything is. The reason you have all these girls cheat on you is because you cannot see them for how they are. Youre not able to see their real values, youre not able to see who they are by just looking into their eyes.Take some time and read some philosophy from ancient Greece, appreciate some fine art, read Wikipedia.Its OK to take time. If you just go out there again like a wild animal, you will be in a wild chaotic abyss of angst, Fear and listlessness.  Just be. Look at how you are thinking here:\"Ive never been good at anything. I suck at school, sports, art..everything. I have considered suicide on and off pretty much since I was 13(Im 20 now). I never had friends Tired long, they always decided they didnt like me and stopped talking to me.\"Each of these thoughts is self enforcing. They were created by you and fed by you. And they will cease to exist when you stop feeding into them. It is a negative thought cycle.No self respecting person accepts negative thoughts, negative emotions or negative people. Try to see the good in everything, to watch nice things and be around people who give you positive feelings.If your boyfriend is just sticking around for the money... well then, that doesnt sound Tired positive, does it? Only you can know if he contributes positive value to your life.But how foolish it is to assume that by going through the same psychological cycles that things would improve. Life works in cycles. Everyones goes to work, goes home and watches TV. That is hardly unusual nowadays.The difference is, people can deal with that because they dont think negative thoughts about themselves. You have to close the doors to all negativity, it is up to you. When you open the doors to negative emotion, then it will sap you greatly.Spend some time around your mother. See the positive in your relationship with her. She can teach you a lot. But you have to be willing to learn.\n",

      "- It started about two years ago. I dont feel like typing out the whole story but my love interest repeatedly made unbelievably stupid mistakes and i was isolated out of Feeling unhappy which led to me answering questions with the help of the internet and finding various intellectual people to listen to. I want to meet a single person in real life that doesnt make me want to compare him to the global wildlife. I know that it would make me feel much better. Of course these people exist. I have no idea how rare they are. \"At the same time, shes open minded, has a big heart, appreciates life and doesnt need an intellectual joke to laugh. Thats also really important stuff to learn.\" What in the world does having a big heart entail? Appreciates life? That depends on her situation. It has next to nothing to do with the person herself. If shes fine with laughing at the same canned, witless jokes every single day, Im not interested. Every single person on this planet should have an open mind. You have not convinced me that i am looking at the \"wrong\" things.I am willing to talk about anything that i can think of out of the top of my head. I am not willing to have the same discussion every single day.  I am typing this with a somewhat severe headache.Ignorance is indeed bliss. Everything that we do is a waste of time. Youre not being rational about some things though. What any other animal does on this planet is just as insignificant as the things that we do. This planet is just as significant as a grain of sand on a massive beach. You shouldnt be so concerned about the fact that we are ruining it. Its unimportant.  We are just as intelligent as the cavemen that discovered fire. We are educated animals and that is why we dont live in a healthy utopia, building homes on other planets. Out of curiosity, How young are you?You call our society \"wrong\". Well, What is right? How do you want our society to function? What exactly is it that you wish to change? \"The way we interact with one another\". What exactly is wrong with common human interaction?What is a \"true\" sense of happiness? Emotions are a result of chemical reactions. There exists only one form of happiness as we know it. You raise many questions and some of them are quite nonsensical. You appear to be intelligent but confused. You wanted to think for yourself and i personally like that. Im not sure where to go from here. I would need more context in order to say more. I can relate to you and thus i feel as if i want to give you a semblance of some sort of aid. I would personally prefer to have never been born, I cant give you any advice when it comes to extortion of Suicidal thoughts but it seems as if you are as aforementioned, confused, and i would relish a chance to bring some matters into light.  I am typing this with a somewhat severe headache. Im not sad, Nor am i glad. I dont care about anything. Ultimately, Everything is pointless. We live on a grain of sand in the middle of an enormous beach. I would prefer to have never been born and yet i dont really want to kill myself. At this point in my life, I could have had been surrounded by friends. I could have had a girlfriend. I am attractive and intelligent. I value rational thought and the ability to question everything. And so what am i doing here, Scrolling up and down this subreddit?Before i go on ill go ahead and tell you that i am currently 14, Close to 15 years old though im hoping that your response will be insightful as opposed to the usual \"Youre a teenager and you have teenage problems. Talk to someone who gets paid to listen to you and your problems will go away, If they dont, Take meds.\"So why have i not surrounded myself with friends? Well, Its because i am not blissfully ignorant. These people, They talk about the same things every single day. They crack the same jokes every time they see fit. To cut it short, I feel as if they are proof against the concept of free will because they dont appear to have a mind of their own. They are easily affected by commercials, They are easily manipulated. And to think that i used to be just like that.Obviously, I shouldnt befriend people who i dont like. I shouldnt enter a relationship with a moron just because shes \"cute\". The problem is that its Tired difficult for me to find another person with a similiar mindset. I want to meet someone who can think of something that i have not already thought about. Someone who can say something that makes me want to call this person a genius. My life appears to be hopeless. I have skipped countless days of school. Sure, I could work towards high degrees but i fail to see a reason when i have lost interest in life in general. I highly doubt that ill ever find another person to care about. I have been staring aimlessly around my room for a while now and my head is pounding. Im not sure where to go from here. My only real way of entertainment is gaming and even that is limited due to shitty economy. I spend my days on the internet, Watching youtube videos, Listening to podcasts, Reading webcomics, Being on reddit. I really dont understand why i so rarely break out in tears. Ill stop typing now. Perhaps ill submit a post of my own. Im not expecting anything. Is there a remedy for my apathy? Sharing a piece of my mind doesnt solve any problems.Nothing can solve this problem, Really. I am helpless.  I may sound a bit offensive, I dont know, Im not actively trying to be a dick.Most of what you have said comes of to me as a load of feel-good jargon and i was expecting to hear that. I was expecting someone to say something along the lines of \"Hey, Youre right,  But just ignore the massive load of shit that is your life and just work hard and your life wont suck anymore.\" Its extremely common.Im not stubborn at all. My mind is open. I look at facts. I know the difference between subjectivity and objectivity. I dont have any unsubstantiated beliefs.Whether or not something is beautiful is entirely subjective. Nobody is born with the will to ride motorcycles. Thats a preposterous claim.Im not sure what to say. You are attempting to appeal to my emotions and while i appreciate the effort, It doesnt appeal to me.  Never did i mention the apparent fact that i am depressed. I am not. I have come to understand the objective fact that my life metaphorically sucks dick and that the people in my social vicinity are in a manner of speaking, retarded. My stance is logical and its not a cause of Emotional upset confusion. I believe that my understanding of our species is quite large in fact. Perhaps i forgot to mention it but i am fully capable of socializing with these people. I just dont like them. Thats the problem. I am not interested in meditation, I might as well just go to a nearby church and accept jesus christ into my heart. I am not going to gobble pills in order to force myself into a positive state of emotion. Its not in any stretch of the imagination a viable solution.\n",

      "- http://i.imgur.com/6A7j9EC.jpg Me :) Yes, I am safe from others harm. Okay thats fine.Its a lot of things. I have bipolar and the past Asthenia and a half I was manic. Now Ive crashed and am Depression. Just standing up takes so much out of me. Sometimes I dont even have a reason to be Depression. My bf is supportive and cares a lot but I feel like eventually its going to get to him and he will break or leave me. I feel like he doesnt put me first (aside from his son, his son is first but I meant other than his son). I am feeling so alone right now and I feel like the best option is suicide. I realize its not the only option but its the one I see that will be best. I will never get rid of my bipolar and Ill always feel so damn awful inside and will be alone forever because of the way I am despite taking medication. I hate myself and I have Anxiety that prevents me from going in public a lot. When Im manic I see shit and and crazy.I have panic attacks often and I feel discouraged. I just want to feel respected and most of all. Happy. I fantasize about putting a gun to my head and pulling the trigger. A part of me feels like I wont even do it because Im scared Theres a hell and that Ill burn forever especially because I just had an abortion. Im fucking damned. Im a pussy because I cant even gain the strength to kill myself. But lately I feel like Im caring less about the consequences and fears. I just want to be gone forever.  Hell yeah I would. It has ruined so many relationships and has caused me horrible suffering.  Sent you my number Thank you :) I feel it. Ive taken Lamictal, Anxiety meds and supplements, worked out, ate healthy, and it still seems like nothing works. It feels useless at times.  I have been through a lot in my life. I was raped by my two half brothers at a young age, dated a 28 year old when I was 13 who just used me, parents divorced, started cutting early, dated a guy who I lived with for 2 years who beat me/controlled me and my life(wasnt even able to talk to my brother)/sexually abused me once, and my dad was abusive over religion. I just want a break. I want the Pain and Pain to end.  I cant change the fact that I have bipolar. I have tried to accept it and try to love myself but its hard because I cant help but feel Depression even if I dont have a reason to be. I love my bfs son Tired much. Im just Worried that my bf is going to Pain me. Hes shown he loves and cares about me but then he does certain things that causes me to feel like he doesnt. \n",

      "- You are not alone, my dear. You have two parents who, from what you said, love you unconditionally. Please please please dont kill yourself. Parents are not supposed to bury their children. At 24, you have SUCH a life ahead of you! This situation is temporary. It really sucks and I feel for you. But as bad as it seems, it will get better. Trust me when I say that it will get better. You have the desire to be more mentally healthy, right? You have the power to change your way of thinking. I know the spiral of starting to believe your negative thoughts. Your brain is LYING to you. You are a wonderful and unique human being with so much to give back. Every day, look in the mirror and name 5 good things about yourself. It will feel silly at first, but something about looking at yourself and saying, e.g., \"I am caring.\" will get you to eventually believe it. Feel free to PM me anytime you need a lift from the darkness.  No life is accidental; especially not yours. I want so much for you to live. I want you to get away from those poisonous people. I want you to start seeing a psychologist (avoid a psychiatrist if you can. they seem more interested in doling out pills than giving you real skills to combat your negative thoughts.). I want you to accept and love yourself for who you are. I want you to get through this and come out the other side. Think of all the young people in similar situations that you can help. You are not alone. You are beautiful. Please dont end your life.  Could you join a support group? Im not sure where you live, so I dont know the resources you have. I found talking to people in similar situations really helped. I would try looking into a psychologist; sometimes a change in therapist is good. Have you asked for help? I know that seems like a silly question and if that came across negatively I am so sorry. I just know that, for me, asking for help was the hardest part. Once I did, I found that so many people wanted to help me. Concerning the license, could you get a bike? Even an old crapper from the thrift store is a start. Exercising will also stimulate those good endorphins and hopefully have you feeling better. I feel ya on the job front. Times are tough and your situation is tougher. Go into every business and put in applications. Once you have a job, its easier to find a better one. The social interactions with your colleagues can also help you feel less isolated. Try not to let your Fear of acceptance deter you. I like to listen to \"I Am What I Am\" from La Cage Aux Follies when Im feeling bad about myself. Back on the subject... all that I have said above will help you escape the prison of your mind. I can see how moving to a more enlightened area will help you. The reality is that, for now at least, youre stuck where you are. So, work on escaping from those negative thoughts. If someone knocks you down (figuratively), get back up. Because we both know that A. you dont deserve that treatment and B. they are full of shit. You are a good person, worthy of love. I have a mental method my psychologist taught me to build myself up; would you like to give it a try? I really hope my words helped you. Look in the mirror and say 3 positive attributes you have. It will feel silly at first, but its important that you maintain this every day. Im on my mobile right now. When I get home Ill write more. \n",

Rarely is a day where I dont suffer from thoughts of self-harm... I hope your days get steadily better. I really do. Best of luck to you.Edit: Hobbies. That really keeps me going. I hope improving a skill will make things brighter for you too.  I too, am a lady, and I agree with Ray_adverb12s advice 100%.

She told me that people will miss me if I were to do it. This is Tired true. People WILL miss you Tired, Tired much. Even you dont even know would miss you if you committed suicide. That girl who you talked about, if you were to do it, you know how sad she would be? She would most likely cry her eyes out, man.I know Im not a helpful person or anything, and Im sorry if I come off a little stubborn, I just had a fight with my father so Im a bit agitated. But what Im getting at is that people will miss you, more than anything. Ill link a video that has a misleading title, but it helped me a bit.Heres the video (Like I said, misleading title): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-K-6r0mSMAI suggest you watch that video immediately.

Good articles; and thanks for your insight.  already there, now i drink alone everyday to kill the Ache Yes, shes even told me she does this, I just dont know how to tell the difference between whats real and what isnt.

Like a failure I was young then and the farm equipment was auctioned off in the mid-80s and the land was rented out to another farmer.It was 40 acres of fields, pasture, and woods. Before I was born it was mainly chicken and egg farm but we had a few cows in pasture in Pennsylvania Dutch area. I always liked the chickens, when about 12 yrs old I had some of my own to raise. I would sit in the chicken house and just watch them interact with each other. Roosters fascinate me in the way they strut and act Hyperactive behavior tough shit in front of their hens.We had a butcher shop in the barn for the cows.There was one time when i was about 6-7 years old and we had a few pigs by chance. I told them not to butcher that one pig because she was pregnant. Well she got butchered anyway and had 7-8 piglets in her. My father said he should have listened to me. love her unconditionally and roll with it or it wont work There was nothing you could have done to stop this.

Thanks thats what I wanted to know I have a plan for next week so none of it matters Love is powerful. So many times Ive said that we were finished yet I always go back for her. Sometimes think I need her more then she needs me, she makes me a better man; a better person. I need to be forced but Ill lose the little Ive built here...thinking This sub-reddit is too depressing to read for me but am aware of it.And I agree that humans make life more complicated than it should be, I often wish I was a sparrow and knew nothing of this human world. I want nothing more than to search for food, build a nest, sing for a mate, and raise my young.Nice story about the desert, I have no knowledge of deserts.  yes. reckless behavior. Like pushing the limits of my car going across the turnpike bridge here, once hit 140 and was drunk off my ass. What a rush. Cant maintain friendships, dunno how Youre right I cant accept myself, I need someone else to first. Ive hatched several plans over the years and this is most recent. A few moments of Abnormal dreams Ache and then is over...Hyperactive behavior a gun shot in the mouth or bleeding out or inhaling helium to i pass out and suffocate. Suicide by cop seems Hyperactive behavior a good option, out in a blaze of glory while fighting for my life against \"the man\" whos always held me back.When young I hated my parents for giving me life. When I was 11 I wanted to jump, in teens it was drug overdose but half hearted, in 20s i was ok, now in late 30s i hate life...its too lonely. If only i had someone to care about.i wanted the childfree lifestyle and got it but its an Depersonalization life, and thats how i see religion; its Depersonalization and unfulfilling, same as Gods so-called love. Need something I can touch and see, my faith just isnt there given my background of studying the history of the universe and earth, could write a book on my view of earth history but whats the point? Money isnt important to me and some people seem BAFFLED by that.Its Hyperactive behavior that i know so much about history and evolutionary theory that God just cannot exist. it makes no sense. The world would be a better place with less people and I can contribute by ending my life.  Same here, Lithium has been great for me; so much so that I dont need any other meds for Bipolar Disorder. The only side effect Ive had from it Dehydration when I dont drink enough water. Im also Type II diabetic. Do the same thing but usually dont send it after some over-analyzing.  Nothing specific, just lonely. always lonely. I put myself out there, I talk to women yet its one rejection after another, been this way for years. 53 is the reason. Im a good person and always do the right things but no one for me Shes been diagnosed as rapid-cycle Bipolar Disorder with pshyotic- something-or-other. I understand, yesterday I went to the local park. There was a fair amount of people there. Kids in the playground, couples playing frisbee or just walking together. Everyone there had someone but I was walking alone, on the swing alone....just wanted to enjoy the nice day but the crippling Sad mood wouldnt allow it. No I wasnt banned but it was suggested that I find other resources by /u/DDbb00.  What keeps me here? I lack the courage to pull the proverbial trigger. Some would say it takes more courage to live than to die. For me its more Hyperactive behavior too Social fear to live and too afraid to die. I cant remember how the saying goes exactly.I hold out hope that somehow, someway Ill find someone who I can adore and that Ill experience mutual love; not just another one-sided relationship. (There have been so many.) The truth about being alone in life hit me hard and not sure Ive fully accepted it. There has to be someone out there whos Hyperactive behavior me, who thinks the same way I do, and has the same wants and needs. But I cant find her...seems Ive been searching my whole life and Im tired. Theres no one for me.Recently Ive read this: http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html  and its given me a lot to think about... Zoloft is crap, get on Lithium. Its done the same to me. Music is my biggest trigger Ive had a real bad Irritable Mood lately, snapped at just about every one of my co-workers this past week and its almost my favorite time of year, not quite cool enough yet. The national one said they cant help me... truly wtf Maybe I have some hope someone will reach out and do right things right. .00001% chance but ya know, when all else has failed, why not? Nothing to lose. Mine seems to be able to take the abuse, the Ache, and there is no history of cancer in my family within living memory, always thought my bloodline was a good one genetically as most of the family makes it into their 90s, but Dementia is a problem for those.Ive given my love away so many times only to have it rejected, heartbreak is all too familiar to me. Makes me feel worthless to live a life with no purpose. No one is close to me. I speak of my roommate who will notice. Ive made arrangements to donate my body to science many yrs ago and will be leaving the number for her to call to get the mess cleaned up.Travel: Not really possible as Im lower class, but have traveled regionally in my yrs here. Id Hyperactive behavior to drive from Pennsylvania to California though.Ive loved many times and always lost, its horrible to be hated by women.  I have no friends and virtually no family, no one would notice Im gone except my employer. And within three weeks Id be replaced there and forgotten. Going to pass-out drunk now so i can be ready for another day of unfulfillingly working for someones dreams to come true. Zoloft 50mg and Lithium 900mg. I love that the Lithium takes my emotions and desires away. I always wanted to try therapy. Being of the lower class makes it difficult to keep a roof over my head let alone an expensive therapist.Im a therapists worst nightmare. Full of \"what ifs\" and \"yea but\"s. hear they dont Hyperactive behavior that sort of thing. Even considered voluntarily/involuntarily committing myself, but the thought of being locked up doesnt appeal to me. She lives 15 mins away, thats acceptable to me. I come from a broken home; my parent split when I was 13. Not much of an impact on me since I lived on the family farm with great aunt and uncle. Both were dead by the time I was 20 yrs old.My Mother is not real; she didnt raise me.Im on several meds for major Mental Depression disorder, none seem to be helping. Im obsessed with death and suicide, I dont belong here. Climbed the ladder and tied extension cord to my branch, its ready. What 2-3 mins of Panic Attacks and its over, no knife in my pocket to cut cord. I just gotta drink some more to get the balls Lonely, ppl hate me unless they want a dollar from me or new member to church congregation.  Im 120 pounds and drink almost half a bottle of whiskey every night, tolerance sucks. At least its killing me slowly...along with the 2-pack/day cigarette habit. Somethings gotta give. Its in the works but nothing yet. I saw a doctor on Wednesday for an unrelated issue and brought up Mental Depression. All he wanted to talk about was my Diabetic history which really doesnt concern me all that much since I know its false.It was a Ache in my lung that I went in for, was hoping it was lung cancer and told him that. And if it was, my plan was to hope for a doctor to ease my Ache because I brought this onto myself I wont seek treatment.Edit : punctuation  I would so Hyperactive behavior to meet another who feels this way. I wanna have that closeness Hyperactive behavior between siblings where you know each other completely but bonds Hyperactive behavior that take years to form and there isnt even anything on the horizon for me. I dont get the chance to show what I have to give. my dick doesnt work on demand, see dude I got something back for everything you can say.

      "- Thanks for your support. Im feeling better now; looks Hyperactive behavior it was just a temporary crisis.  It comes and goes, and it doesnt always have a specific cause, per se. Ive been Depressed mood in one form or another since I was about 12, and Im 25 now. All kinds of Phobia, Social Anxiety Mental Depression issues and possibly PTSD due to emotional abuse, according to my therapist.Right now I guess its a combination of feeling utterly isolated and hating myself profoundly. I havent had any close friends outside my husband for the past seven years due to the aforementioned Phobia, Social Anxiety Mental Depression, and I just feel Hyperactive behavior I have to constantly hide behind this idiotic veneer of politeness and submissiveness whenever Im near anyone but him. It feels Hyperactive behavior Ive been wearing the mask for so long that I dont even know who I am anymore. I dont recognize myself, and I hate this cowardly stranger thats wearing my face. Im starting my fourth year of a masters degree that was supposed to take two and I still have no idea when Ill be done. My scholarships have run Thirst and I cant really afford to take any more classes right now and my student loans will come due soon. Im not even sure I want to do this anymore. Everything just feels so hopeless. Sorry if that didnt make much sense. Everything is all twisted up in my head.  Thank you for asking, though. \n",

Who is feeling special? You are subscribing for what reasons exactly? Take your meds What do you want?  Doctors are there to help, that is there job, they have heard all of this before. Just relax and explain what is wrong, as you would any other illness. It will be fine. It happens. I wrote a few works while depressed. But I realised that there is no real reason to have to. I think it was more of looking for a reason to live. In my opinion, get healthy and then work. Once you get through or just manage your Depression you will still have the same reason to work creatively.  well thats not a bad way to be either be less of a muppet or enjoy time on your own Since early teens, every single day I have thought about it. I want to die. it will get better and you will be okay I dont know. I really dont.Positives are I am still alive.But why stay alive is you are weighted down by this constantly It doesnt make much sense.Constant Anxiety and Depression is not a decent life. Perhaps you should go and listen to your therapist then. And speak to your doctor.  yeah gotta get on it more Philosophy Thank you for your thoughts. shall do my friend No, I never thought of it, who would fire me anyway? I am a wreck. Im saving that 20 seconds of courage for when I jump :-( I do not have money. I do not have a passport actually. Ok Just need to get some things in order. older but successful and happier (truly mean this) I am happy that you have found something like that in your life :-) I try to help everyone I can. I am not a bad person really. I dont even want to make people sad when I die. I have found a place where it will look like an accident. It is Tired nice. Beautiful spot. I understand. Realistically all that is open to me is minimum wage menial work. Everyone says study but I cannot afford that and dont think my mind would be able to study again. So the offer is if I am lucky get a minimum wager till I get fed up. Great. Just great.  Writing. But I have failed at that. I wrote many things, finished, completed, had great hopes for them. Cannot get a production or a publisher. All avenues are dust. yes I think so Well to be fair i cannot answer questions personally related to you. I think I was trying to hopefully help someone who was feeling down is all. I am a failure. I am too old to change. I cant change. It is a truth I have come to accept. Why the date? Killing yourself in Jan is a cliche and Feb is wet here. Sounds stupid but thats it.  watch out for yourself well good luck &gt; Most recently, Ive seen people who have done a quarter of what Ive done in the industry get my dream job and now theyre set for life.Many people will dismiss this if they read it but I absolutely agree. This happens to me all the time. People with 1/10th the talent and ability and hard work ethic walking - FUCKING WALKING - into positions I would excel at.I use the Feeling angry though, the frustration, it makes me want to succeed even more - PETTY? So fucking what?I dont know if this helps, it did for me. But maybe think about it. Channel the negative into this.Good luck This was lovely thank you no utterly worthless Go to a country that offers free, English-language university education, e.g. Germany.What? I dont have the money to move to be honest. It might be scarier to move. With all this baggage in a strange place. If you know what I mean. OP  it is the only thing keeping me alive at the moment. Potential does not always work out. If you are wasting air you need to step aside. Yes I do have one life. Mine. I chose to end it. I am glad. I dont disagree in what you are saying I disagree in the way that you did it. Very dangerous. I read 2 posts from users saying they wanted to post but were now afraid? That is not fair.And imagine if someone in real need is looking for help right now. Perhaps someone could have, but they are on here fighting or the poor child didnt bother to post because of some unwanted fear.It is a meaningless internet point. You have gone in the wrong direction here. I dont see it. The reality is they will most likely get worse. Economic factors are unavoidable.  2 decades is enough. I cannot take any more failure. If you are too much of a coward to defend your accusations shall I just tag you are such? No I am tired. I have nothing. I never will. So much potential resulted in nothing but pain. Answer that question and get back to us. The job really is not important to me. I know that sounds arrogant but I just cant get excited over minimum wage in a shop at my age. That is if they are even out there. Recession in Ireland. Lots of people out of work. But the reality is I made a mistake with my degree. I thought I would be successful now. I cannot get my work taken by anyone. I have made my bed. I have failed. Maybe I set the bar too high, but that is where I will fall from. Onto the sand. The water can take me then. Perhaps I never will be found. Sorry I was away from the internet. I looked into freelancing but I do not really have those skills. Sorry :-( It has been 5 years since my last major episode, there have been a dozen minor ones in between but I cannot even do a basic exam or study with intensity for any period of time. I have a degree but I am unable to understand a lot of what I read. Everything gives me Anxiety. Change is tough. No money or job, hard to find one here. In a position where my success is related directly to other people and there is nothing I can do about it.I dont know why I think about death all the time. Just feel like it is the natural state for me to be gone.That sounds stupid I know. I wish you all the luck. 33 hours. Fuck. I hope you get through it.  All I am skilled is horrible min wage jobs that I cant even get. Its a pointless life.  Your teachers used to bully you?Your parents tell you to fuck off? I wish I could play it though it is fascinating. I will try. I am afraid of getting attached.  I go to one pub and like to watch Arsenal. I cant afford to go to a match really. I cannot own a dog as it would not be fair on the dog when I am dead. They might. Or they might not. I read some stuff and it did seem like it could help people so I would encourage others to. I have been Depression clinically for two decades diagnosed. Every job I did made my Depression worse actually which is ironic. I am sorry I just dont know if I have the energy any more  I have no skills. I am not practical. I am weak. I have a liberal arts degree which is useless. Every job I did was minimum wage. That is all I can get. Sad really. Why are you directing this at the userbase? The downvotes are coming from trolls who are not real subscribers or contributors to this sub. This is really misjudged my friend. And I think many of your upvotes are coming from the exact trolls who get a kickout of this. Just consider it. I dont no. I think it is impossible to prove one way or the other but no. Maybe I could. The shelter is many miles away without buses and I do not drive. I make a lot of mistakes. People think I am worthless. I cause problems. I want to die quietly. Every memory seems tinted though. That is the Depression. I dont think you understand. They will upvote you, because they like the drama. They like the fact they are annoying subscribers on here. They will push you to the top so they can enjoy the fallout.  In real life I am a cretin. I am alone. be successful, cant do anything really, even on good days it only lasts a while And you need one to teach :-( I just was hoping other people might take solace is the conversation. I am gone. I know this. I have said that my nerves will kill me before my Depression.I have no advice, I am still crippled, but I wish you the best. You can get through it, good luck yes it does You sound like you are 12. Go to a therapist and talk instead of insulting your friends. I am physically ok it seems why? You could have asked politely and quietly, I think the ideas would have been taken on board by the community.&gt; moderators capitulating the to the request/demand that improvements be made.Has anyone asked for these changes before? Mods?&gt; In the end theyre only doing this subreddit a favor.Now you attracting all the worst parts of reddit to mess with the sub. You may have damaged it quite badly. This was badly misjudged my friend.  I feel like one. Because of my failures. I think they are intertwined.  I am awful at chess. I have never been so bad at a game than chess.  Ive got a year so anything could happen. I will not be surprised if it gets worse. I think I would be just a burden my friend. Way I am thinking now. I cannot reconcile how anyone is to exist with such constant Pain. It does not seem practical.  I have never heard of these jobs and after a Sharp Pain look around I doubt they are available here without some modicum of training in social work.  Fill your life with other people who will care. Please respond to my concerns, you have insulted and bad mouthed me on this subreddit. I wish to hear your explanations or an apology.  Thanks, I took some time to myself since the post. Nothing really changed. At the moment yes. I am sorry but I think I have to. I cannot picture a life whereby I go to work, scrape enough to survive and return to an empty house for the next thirty years. Who would want that? Well maybe my ego. I am sorry. Ireland. Have you experience of this? I have friends in Berlin now who cannot find employment and whose money is running out.  Seek help. I have never heard of this in my country. I dont deserve it anyway. Other people should benefit from this. This will soon make it to subreddit drama and you will have even more unfortunately.  That is what I am thinking. thank you how do you know it gets better for meit probably wont :-( I do but I will not say it to them. Can you imagine working in Dunnes for minimum wage for the next 30 years? That is if I was lucky enough to get a job. Living in an overpriced rented house which takes most of your money? Coming home to nothing and no one. Watching RTE game shows in the evening. Crying. Afraid to get a dog because you wouldnt want it to starve if you decided to do something on the spur.Walking the city in the rain because you have nothing to do and no one to talk to. There is nothing there. It is empty. People pass content. You even envy the drunks arguing for at least they have someone to talk to. Summer ends and the last light goes down. It is orange. Tinted with strawberry but you see no beauty in it. Only shame. This will be my last summer. I might even go to the parade this year. Normally avoided it. I hate the fact we cant get guns easy in this country. I wont be able to cut myself, am terrified of things around my neck and pills are too dangerous. I am jumping off a cliff somewhere I know. It is lovely there. Perhaps it will be a sunny day. I want to die at sunset. I like to drink. I like to watch the football on the television. I like dogs.  Yes this is what I was thinking. You shouldnt feel that much difference within mere hours of starting. Nothing, it killed my love for it. I barely passed. I dont get through every day well. I understand. I cannot get anything produced or published.  Do you speak to a therapist? If not it might be a good idea. Your age is difficult for various reasons, and if you are feeling off it could be a variety of things. Why do your parents speak like that to you? I have a bike, I must fix it up. I unfortunately have a time limit. I felt as much Not at all :-) 4 years now. I had a minor breakdown. The job situation is not the problem. I have hated every job I ever did and they contributed to my ill health. I am looking seriously now for anything in fear. I had one interview in 60 applications. I find solace only on friday evening when I know there will be no post from the government people. One more year. Thats it. I am Crying now. Happily Crying. One more year. Thats it. No more worries. Maybe it will come sooner if there is an accident. That would be good. Terrible childish thinking really. I am a grown man. Guess that makes it worse. I wish I had a handgun I could have an accidental discharge and no one would label me.  no No, are you on medication? Unfortunately it is in a creative field and is out of my Weakness of hand for the most part. I submit and I wait and I am rejected. Cant afford to stage it myself. Doesnt matter anyway. Sorry about your father. :-( me too, it was something small, i thought it was over, now i am here, have to leave house, break lease, sucks Fuck that. Fuck them. Fuck your therapist who should be shot in the head.Do your own thing. Lie till you can move out. I will have to look again.  In my 30s now. Picked wrong degree. Applying for jobs as a car park assistant and a shop keeper part time. Wont be enough to live on. Seems rather bleak.  No I dont find it frightening. I dont know what I think about it. I am a waste. I am unemployed for years. I have no chance of anything other than minimum wage until I die. This is not a joke. I am mid 30s. I cannot afford to go back to college. There are no loans in this country like america. I let down everyone. I am constantly unhappy. I spent two decades like this. That is enough. I cannot say I did not try. Oh mercy that is terrible. Hope you will be okay. I cannot remember when I was last genuinely happy. That is the truth. I must have been a child. I looked at the MFA. Cant afford :-( Moderation - yes I have. No side effects outside of the normal - alcohol can be dangerous etc. Mainly I would have to plan this event by saving out of 88 bucks a Asthenia (inc. food and bills) after I pay the rent. It is impossible. Thank you. No you are more important it should be about you. You seem to have real troubles. my calling is to be a mid 30s man with no skill sets, unemployed for years who cant even get a min wage job in a shop and has no chance of reeducation or movement that is not life Get diagnosed first. \n",

      "- say something if youre still there. hope i didnt arrive too late. Youre only 14 years old? Incredible because youre writing comes off so intelligent, like an adult.I have some things to say to you regarding one of your statements:\"These thoughts are so overwhelming, and Im starting to accept them, and I know that if life takes one more thing from me, Im going to act on them, if I dont just act on it randomly one day.\"If you pay attention, you may notice that all of the Suicidal inclinations originate within the mind, namely from the thoughts. Have you ever wondered where these thoughts come from? These thoughts seem foreign dont they? Indeed, they come to us from our spiritual enemies, the demons who hate mankind with perfect malice. The demons are able to transmit thoughts to us, as if shooting arrows or casting poisonous darts. The thoughts are the weapons they use against us. The demons compass about us, swarming upon us, refusing to leave us alone. They obtain power over us because to some degree we share in their darkness.They are spiritual parasites, who steal energy from us, by inciting negative emotions via the transmission of thoughts to the intellect which is a part of the human soul. These thoughts incite hatred, anger, jealousy, lust, greed, all kinds of negativity. Their ultimate goal is to destroy us. When they attack, often like piranhas on a feeding frenzy, the human heart becomes overwhelmed with despair, despondency, fear, anger, resentment, and a distraught psychological state that is difficult to escape from, and recognizable by its effects.When these evil thoughts are accepted, the thought enters into the heart, where it spawns an emotion, that is, a feeling, with which the thought joins, and the combination of the negative thought with a negative feeling, tends to effect one or two things: it will either produce an action, or a desire/inclination to perform that same action.If you have never followed through with the action, then the effect is a desire/inclination to perform the action, and the action itself is easier to resist. However, once you begin accepting the thoughts, which will assault us repeatedly, it becomes increasingly difficult to resist the inclination/desire to perform the resulting action.Its spiritual warfare. We must resist the demons. When we accept their lies, it gives them greater power over us. Day after day they come to us and inject thoughts into the mind, designed to cause despair, self-hatred, hopelessness, etc. Then they will tell you to kill yourself. And they will come and attack you again and again, for days, weeks, months and years. They know it will wear a person down if they are relentless. They may relent temporarily if it helps their cause; if they see us doing things that harm us, like using drugs. But they are simply lying in wait, like wolves. If someone begins to believe the lies the demons tell them in their thoughts, the demons weaken us and they become stronger, feeding off the despair or whatever negative emotions/actions they incite. Demons seek to conquer a person in small steps. If they seek your destruction via suicide, they will start small, making you feel like an economic/academic/social failure, not good enough, ugly, unlikable, etc. Things to make us feel bad about ourselves, unloved, and hopeless. Among these smaller steps, the demons try to get you to start cutting yourself or Burning sensation yourself; banging your head against the wall, punching the wall, breaking things. Once you start hurting yourself, following through on the desire/action that is produced by the acceptance of the thought into the heart, then it becomes harder and harder to resist the actions they seek, and the behavior begins to hard wire itself into the brain, where it becomes a behavioral pattern. For example, if you live in a 2 story house, you can run up and down the stairs Tired fast without thinking about it. Its become a hard wired action. Another example: People who become addicted to smoking, can have a streamlined behavior pattern: a thought to smoke, automatic acceptance of the thought into heart, and desire and action are virtually united into a single step: person reaches for cigarette and lights it. The whole thing becomes a seamless transaction. At this point, a person can virtually lose the freedom of their will in regard to the action. This is also how addictions form within the human person.The problems you are experiencing cannot get better so long as you accept these negative thoughts. It is not easy to overcome these thoughts, since they dont come from within you. Thats why many Suicidal people think that they cant get better. The demons wont leave them alone but instead relentlessly attack the person, until the person loses their mind and gives up the fight, ending their life.There is a whole methodology to heal oneself, to overcome these dark forces. First time signing up at reddit. Felt inclined to reply.Im 35 and was in and out of mental hospitals all throughout high school, up to my early 20s. I sliced my self up pretty bad a few times. Was Suicidal for years, no hope, saw no future.After high school I decided to just use drugs and not worry about life, just be a bum pretty much, and gave up on ever caring about accomplishing anything.I made it through that dark period by giving up caring about anything.My life turned out okay. I mean yeah, Im a failure at economic success and making money but who cares! If all you ever wanted was to be rich, then youve been duped. Money is just a false hope people are brainwashed to chase. Lots if people committing suicide or being totally miserable are rich. Money doesnt make people happy. It may seem to for a little bit, but then look, no one is ever satisified with how much they have. Theyve done surveys, asking people their annual income, and how much annual income is needed to be \"rich\"/\"successful. Every single income bracket did not consider their own income enough to be rich. All the way from the poorest to the richest. People who make half a million dollars a year think they need to make a million to be rich. Its a joke. And everyone is deceived by this.1. How old are you.Like I said, Im 35 now. And my life is still a life of suffering, but I have a wife and several children now. Im on welfare and a failure in the American workplace. And I could list tons of reasons why my life sucks and why Im a failure as a human. But Im happy I didnt kill myself when I was younger. Having children made my life worth living, even though I suffer so much. These beautiful kids would never have existed if I had committed suicide.Look, understand life is terribly painful, but we cant just assume our Pain will end at death.Looking back, I realize I didnt actually want to die. What I truly wanted was for my suffering to end. And because it was so painful, I hated myself, I just wanted to die. It seemed like the only way I could escape. Friend, there is no escape. You must have a small speck of hope. A mans spirit within him is endued with hope at conception. All people have a glimmer of hope no matter how dark life gets. Thats why we reach out to others when we are at the point of suicide. Its why youre here.Please dont kill yourself.You are valuable. You are important. You matter. People care about you.Remember in High School, probably you knew someone at your school, or knew of them, who committed suicide. And everyone acted sad. Even though no one acted like they cared about the person. And usually many people say, \"I wish there was something I could have done.\" Or if I had only known I would have tried to help.So there are people whi help and people who care. If you reach out, maybe even youll need to reach far, people will reach out their hand to pull you up from the grave.Suicide is permanent. Your current problems are probably temporary. The problems I had, the reasons I had for suicide when I was young, for the most part dont affect me anymore. I still have problems, but its not like before. And so I encourage anyone who is Suicidal, or is making a big decision like this to wait.When in doubt go without.Maybe you should wait 1 day for each year of your life that is passed to decide to make the ultimate decision, irrevocable and terrible: destroying oneself.So if youre 18 years old, wait 18 days to decide. Until you can be 100% sure this is what you want to do, for 18 days, you should not act. Dont make a mistake like this unless you are fully and irrevocably committed. Killing yourself is permanent. Theres no changing your mind.I can write more if youre interested in talking. Ive been there myself.If youre just here to say farewell, I would still like to hear more about you and what it is that leads you to such a drastic end. Forgive me for anything wrong I said.\n",

      "- Then lets explore that, because self-hate isnt a simple thing. Ive been there, I really have, and its awful, but you need to look at why you hate yourself so that you can begin to deal with it.Its not always that we need to change, but that we need to change our perceptions of ourselves, you know? And still a human being.Inciting suicide is tantamount to murder. Ive recently passed 1 year clean, and its still in my head every single day. I know exactly how you feel, and it completely fucking sucks that its always there, and youre always thinking about and wanting to do it.Id suggest the elastic band/tight hair band thing - snapping it on my arms always helps (but careful not to do it too hard and too much in one place, as it leaves these marks that can stay there for well over a day). The only problem is that the Pain is short lived. Like, cuts are Pain when you cut, and then for quite a while afterwards, but Pain from the rubber bands/hair bands fades too quickly, so you have to do it more often.  Why is that? Im not doubting you or your judgement, but I would like to hear more, Id like to know why you feel this is the case. Im really sorry to hear youve lost family members and had all of these problems. Its really easy for this stuff to stack up and get on top of you, so its important that youre able to talk about it to deal with it all. Its awful that youve lost the person who has helped you through so much, it really is, but it isnt the end. You can deal with this stuff, suicide isnt your only option.Firstly, is there anyone else you can turn to? I ask, because obviously, finding a new confidante would be a great way to help you get back on track. Now, if you dont think theres anyone you can turn to, have you considered seeking professional help? It gets suggested often because it really does help to have someone just listen to you, and give input when you need it. Therapists can help guide you through your problems in a way that sometimes even close friends cant.It may also help to bring something new into your life, to focus yourself on. Its not going to solve anything, but it will really help take your mind off of things so that it doesnt seem so much. Yes, I definitely prefer to do it slow, even if emotionally Im a wreck at the time, going slow is always better. Im always wary of depth, especially since I used to cut mostly on the insides of my thighs, because I dont want to knick a vein or artery; suicide isnt my goal.I cut deeper than I used to, but thats because with experience has come a greater awareness of the maximum depth I should cut to. I dont want excessive Bleeding, because anything that might create too high of a risk of Infection or become problematic in some other way would mean going to the doctors/hospital - something I must avoid at all costs. See, the reason threads like this dont get much attention is because it feels impersonal, like youre just saying Im the problem solver! Let me solve all the problems!.If you really want to help, then try and make sure nobody is left hanging; nobody on here should go unanswered. If you read someones post, and feel like you can help, then absolutely go for it. Your effort is admirable, it really is, but this probably isnt the best way for you to help out. You deserve a lot better than the lot youve got, but I promise that if you just hang in there, things are going to look up for you.I know others have said their inboxs are open if you need to talk, and obviously you can post here whenever you need help/advice, but just PM if you feel you need to, Im always listening. Were not here to judge, or to tell you to stop. I know how it helps to make you feel, but just make sure you take care of yourself. If you do want to try and stop, then places like /r/StopSelfHarm and /r/depression can be excellent resources and communities. Its always easier to stop anything when you have support from others.  OP, have you considered that a lot of us dont want to stop? That it works for us? That were safe?Ive been raised inside a family filled with nurses, so safety has been drilled into me since... ever. Im careful not to cut where there may be exposed arteries, and I clean every single wound - if it causes too much Bleeding or gets infected, that means a trip to the hospital and unwanted exposure, so Id bet the vast majority of us are safe.And fyi, self-harm is suicide prevention. Ill reply all night if you want me to. You deserve a life, a good one, and if you hang in there, you can have one. &gt; and water Common cold water, not warm. Definitely do not use warm water to clean out the blood.  &gt; heart basically stopped.I know that feeling.You think someone is about to discover your SH, and your stomach just drops and this pit opens up inside you. Its the fucking worst feeling. Yeah, Im kinda confused as to why s/he chose to restrict this to one country.... Shame usually led me to.throw them away, but Id usually use them a few times. I keep the last blades I used symbolically - but if I relapse then yup, frenzy of trying to pull the blades off my razor again. I almost relapsed a month ago - closest Id been since stopping - after I was robbed and had all my valuables stolen, and the only thing that stopped by was that I couldnt get the damn blade off my razor. Gave me time to calm down a bit, and think about what I was about to do.  Ive been in the situation where someone who was suicidal, who I was talking to, had been making really big improvements in his life and taking some really positive steps, suddenly regressed and set a date for his suicide. I became extremely concerned, and there was nothing I could do to sway him. I tried to subtlety gather information so I could get him help. He needed it, and I couldnt do anything more via skype. He stopped talking to me before I could gather enough info to do anything, but it was before the date he set to kill himself.When its a choice between someone dying, and getting someone into a place where they cant Pain themselves and could potentially get the help they need - most of us will choose the latter. Im sorry that it was a horrible experience, but you cannot expect people to stand aside and let you die. Obtaining permission to contact people is ideal, but sometimes its not possible without endangering your efforts to stop them killing themselves.  Its because of my level of awareness that I feel comfortable using it as a coping mechanism.When Ive considered suicide, usually at the peak of Emotional upset distress, Ive made myself calm down and think Is this the logical decision?, as in, is this absolutely the right decision that has been thought through, or am I experiencing heightened Emotional upset Pressure? Its the same kind of thing with cutting. I know many people here feel it controls them, but I most certainly dont. Im making a conscious choice, in the same way I do if I decide not to eat for a day or decide not to leave my bed for however long etc. It isnt my sole coping mechanism, its one of many. I can, and do, control myself. I know what can happen, but I also know what happens when I lose control; I close in on suicide again. I will not always be able to stop myself, and these coping mechanisms help prevent me from reaching a mental state where I have to.And I promise you; nobody is affected other than me. I just use razor blades, and cut my thighs. I normally only do two or three cuts at one time, although sometimes it may be double that (three on each thigh, for example). I guess its the most common method because its the easiest. I have a ton of razor blades for shaving anyway. Its not weakness; you opened yourself up to someone, gave yourself to them - that takes more bravery than a lot of people can muster. Unfortunately, it hasnt worked out for you as you planned.But I really hope that you come to realise that this is so far from the end... The Pain fades, albeit after much Emotional upset Pain and longing for what you thought could have been, but it does fade. Im not telling you to let go, but I do believe wholeheartedly that youll find your way back from the wilderness youre in because of what youre going through. Hang in there, yeah? Okay, calm down, take a deep breath, and lets think about this.Are you sure theres no place for you to go? Nobody you can stay with for just a while? Youre not alone, youre reaching out for help, and there are always people online who will help if they can. If you really cant find anywhere to stay, Id suggest going to [/r/askreddit](/r/askreddit) or something similar, as theyll either help you directly or point you in the direction of a subreddit that can.This is a temporary situation, and we cant let them get the best of us. Try to remain calm and collect yourself, because youre going to have to keep focused to get past this tough time, but you will if you reach out, which youre doing. Im always a bit fearful about my blades being discovered :/ But your boyfriend sounds pretty great about it, so take solace in that at the Tired least? In the UK you literally cant buy enough ibuprofen or paracetamol to overdose on from any one place. Youd have to go to more than one shop, and even then, theyre all individually wrapped so it would take ages to try and overdose.  Ive been guilty of giving advice on cleaning wounds, so I apologise. I base it on my experience, and coming from a nursing family, where I kind of just know how to treat minor wounds and ailments because I was raised that way - its like common sense for me, but youre absolutely right, it Falls under giving medical advice.  No... I dont think thats a fair comment to make. The people most likely to respond to your post are the ones who think the same as you.I wasnt going to respond, but I saw this comment and felt obliged to point out that I certainly dont hate people, and I dont gate being touched, and I enjoy the company of others more than anything in the world. That is not even remotely similar.  Asking for help is failing; its bravery.Often, the hardest thing we can bring ourselves to do is admit that we cant cope, that things are too much, and that we need help. And its brave. Youre brave.Im really sorry that your mother was abusive, that must have been horrible. My parents also got divorced (when I was 7), and although my father wasnt really abusive, he did hate me whilst simultaneously adoring my brothers. Im telling you this because I want you to know that youre not alone, and that feeling of Numbness can be brought on by so many things, and there isnt any one way to deal with it.But taking your own life isnt the solution. You may not be able to think of a reason why you want to live right now, but that doesnt mean there isnt one. It sounds to me like you need to talk, to feel again. If youre able, a professional to listen to you is just about the most liberating experience, and it could really help you reconnect with the world. Youll have an outlet for that anger, and someone who really will listen to you, and remember that nothing you say is pathetic, it means something to you, so it means something, and its important.I cant really suggest any particular outlets other than finding something for you to focus on. It could be something as simple as a sport or hobby, but could also be helping out at a charity or other type of project. Anything that gives you some direction and focus will help you see that theres so much to live for, and so much to look forward to.  Lifelong Eczema sufferer here; cocoa butter cream is what youre looking for OP.To date, no other cream has soothed Itching as much as cocoa butter. It has the added benefit of helping to make scars fade if applied over longer periods of time. If youve already itched a lot and it has become inflamed, then you want to take cetirizine antihistamines (just one).NOTE: Ask at the chemist to double check with the antihistamines. Im giving you this advice based on 22 years of medical history solving chronic Itching.  This is my feelings exactly. This might sound harsh, but the posts soliciting PMs and Im here to help!! always seems a little superficial to me :/ And highly ineffective. I absolutely hate seeing posts unanswered, because having been there myself, to put yourself on the line and be ignored... its shattering... It should always be a priority to make sure nobody goes unanswered, so that they know theyre heard at the Tired least. I think thats up to you. When I get to my absolute limit, and feel ike Im going to snap and break my clean streak, I snap the rubber band on my wrist until I calm down. I still consider myself clean, because Im not cutting, and for me thats the goal.  &gt; In my state its perfectly legal to shoot and kill someone to prevent an imminent rape of oneself or a third partyAnd in my country, thats illegal. In fact, if you were shot by a civilian whilst committing a crime, youd have a feasible case to sue them. Above and beyond every arbitrary law, there are human rights, rights we all have access to at all times, the most fundamental of which being the right to life. I know you probably know this - but its people thinking they can apply the \"it gets better\" to depressed/self harming/suicidal people. Its been covered a lot in /r/SuicideWatch. But that campaign specifically pertains to LGBT people, and LGBT specific issues.  At 14, I had a similar problem. My circumstances were different in that self-loathing about my sexuality led to self-destructive behaviour and attitude, but I was in the same rut youre in now.How your life looks at 14 doesnt reflect the outstanding person youre going to become. Youre going to find your calling in life, whether in 2 years or 10, and from that youll make your own way totally independent of your siblings; people will stop comparing you to them because youll be your own person with your own life. Youre going to have new experiences and meet tons of new people, and youre going to hate some of them, but youre also gonna hit it off with others, because thats just how it works. Things might look shitty now, because you have the unfortunate luck of being stuck in a place where people dont appreciate you for who *you* are; for that Im truly sorry, but you know what? Youre gonna climb out of that dump and youre gonna start finding out who you are, and meet others who do love and appreciate you no matter what.What youre going through now is awful, and it may seem like its going to go on forever - but all of this is going to end, and youre going to be awesome. So frickin awesome.  Always clean them. Always. If you dont then you risk infection, which means Tired bad trip to the doctors or worse - the hospital.I used stuff called TCP, a fantastic multipurpose antiseptic. You can apply it with toilet paper, but its much better to apply it with specialised medical gauze. If youre looking to not raise suspicion from people you live with, then just use elastoplasts (also known as band-aids) to cover the wounds once youve cleaned them thoroughly.  Hey, I dont know what has lead you to this, but would you mind talking about it? Whats happening in your life to make you feel like this is the only option? Starvation isnt self harm, starvation would be more akin to attempted suicide. Self harm prevents us from doing anything worse; cuts, burns, Contusion - they mean we dont kill ourselves, and were able to cope. Starvation is a direct threat to your life. If youre feeling like you need to starve yourself, then please see a therapist/councillor or doctor.  Hey, lets talk about this. Whats on your mind? Well if you feel that his work is a visual representation of what youre going through, then Id imagine it would terrify you, as I know it would me. Think of it like The Picture of Dorian Gray.  Well, I dont really find that to be an issue... Dude. **Rule number 1** for SH is *always* keep your wounds clean. *Always*. Infections means questions. Always have a bottle of TCP to treat wounds afterwards, including burns (though sudocrem would be better suited to burns). First off, hi. Youre absolutely right that writing it out helps, because it lets you take everything thats swirling around in your head and arrange it cohesively, where its easier to understand. Reading your first paragraph was like reading some of the things Ive written myself before; when Im feeling particularly... down... I write down what Im feeling. Everything. All of it. So you writing this out is a great start, Id say.Try not to think so much about what others will think about you; the most important thing is what you think of you. We dont always like what we see, because were overly critical of ourselves, but also often blinded by negative emotion. Try not to doubt yourself so much; I know, easier said than done right? But thats probably where youre going to have to start, because until you see that youre an intelligent, beautiful, loving person, then youll struggle to realise your ambitions. You feel like theres no job prospects for you, and I dont know what youre field is or what jobs you hope to get, but as someone in a field of slim chances, I can tell you not to let that get to you. You got into your field for a reason, now let that reason guide your ambition.Things are going to get better for you, because youve hit a low, so the only place you can go is up, and you most certainly will if you give yourself the chance. I wish I could help. I was always afraid my last boyfriend would see my scars (also mostly on my thighs), but I managed to keep them secret.If youre super uncomfortable with people seeing them when theyre exposed and commenting, then tell them first? Lie, if you have to, and say theyre from something else - either way, it would stop unwanted questions. I know from past experience that I just cannot deal with questions. Thanks. I always downvote them because it makes me feel uncomfortable to have them here, like there are people reading through our posts to pry and study us like test subjects.  Hey, I just wanted to link you to this:http://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/wiki/index#wiki_how_do_i_care_for_burns.3FIts from the wiki, and it will give you accurate advice for treating burns. Always remember to treat your wounds; if can seriously impact your health not to, and trips to the doctors or hospital for not treating it could mean sudden exposure to friends and family about your SH.  If you love them, and they love you, then thats a great start :)What exactly is making you feel like you need to end your life? Then maybe find something outside of your norm, something new to invest yourself in? Finding self-worth isnt always easy, but finding something that gives meaning to your life can be a great thing. You have art; thats absolutely brilliant! Art is an amazing medium of expression, so expand into that area - visit art galleries, talk with other artists on reddit and in real life, look for community art societies and projects.I have to apologise here, but its 2am, and I really cant stay up any longer tonight, but PM me and we can keep talking tomorrow, okay? I think its a perfectly acceptable coping mechanism so long as, as you stated, youre controlling it. As a means of dealing with overly strong emotions/experiences, it beats out pretty much everything else; its easier, quick, and doesnt have many adverse affects - as long as you can keep control. Controlled self-injury means, for me, a life without excessive Stress and a life where I can deal with all the shit I have on my plate. Its worked for 2 years, and Ill probably need it for a few years more, but I know that I can stop if I need to, Im careful when I cut (and obviously always clean the cuts... if it gets infected then Id have to go to the doctors and explain it), and although Im not ashamed per se, I do find that its best not to tell other because they may not understand it.It will be seen by others in the light of loss of control and total inability to deal with things, when I feel its quite the opposite. So yeah, as long as youre in control, keep doing it, but if you feel like its taking over, like its an addiction or always your first port of call whilst the cuts get deeper and deeper and more frequent, then maybe its time to scale things back. Our futures often turn out differently to how we imagined, but thats alright.Dont feel like you need to rush anything, because Emotional upset Pain can last for a long time - do things in your own time frame. Just try to deal with your emotions, and not dwell too much on what could have been, youll be okay :) I know what you mean. And it can come on just all of a sudden. I try to not be a pushy anti-SH person, but Im doing pretty well not cutting (not cut since February), and hope my titbits can help others, maybe. But yeah, evenings are the worst for me. I really struggle some nights, and end up needing my elastic band.... a lot.  I think this is better placed in [/r/StopSelfHarm](/r/StopSelfHarm)?Its just that not all of us want to stop or have any intention of stopping. I dont want you to die.When you look at life through shit stained glass, then sure, its gonna look shit, but life can and will get better for you. Youre at university yeah? Well, I can speak from experience when I say Societies are a great way to find a new direction or purpose, and certainly a great way to meet new people and friends. What do you enjoy? Because theres something for everything, thats the great thing about university.As a gay guy, I can empathise with the position youre in with your mother. You say she would be destroyed, but shes your mother, and chances are, shell still love you. If she doesnt, and/or you are rejected by the rest of your family, then I can tell you that this isnt the end of the world, and you can move forwards.And thats what I think you need most, a direction in life. I cant tell you what to do, but I can tell you that finding yourself a new purpose is something that can be really life changing. If you cant find something through university, look around your local community, is there a project or program that you think you could take part in? Its gonna require you to be more proactive, but I promise you it will give you a new gusto and really help you find where to go.Please dont kill yourself, youre my age, you have a long life ahead of you that will get better. I cant promise its always going to be easy, or that its going to get better overnight, but things are going to look up, and when they do, itll be all the sweeter because of what youve been though. &gt; I feel more like it gives me a sense of relief when I feel upset, or angry.Thats exactly how it helps me, but I still feel like Im doing it, I could choose not to if I wanted, but I chose to do it because of the relief it brings. No it absolutely is not a form of self harm. Im extremely disturbed that you think it is, extremely. Self harm is suicide prevention. Of coping. Take your horrible pro-suicide views to /r/suicideology where they belong, they are NOT welcome here. Definitely. Youre weary, and emotionally at your most vulnerable when youre on youre own at night. Your guard is down, youve let loose, and with that comes everything... usually the negative. OP, it helps to try and be around people you love and trust when it feels like too much. You dont need to tell them how you feel or anything; just being around those kinds of people honestly helps.  And thats great that he seems somewhat understanding... like you say, most people havent got a clue, and attach so much stigma and make it such a taboo... to have someone close not judge you is great :) It might seem like your family hates you on the surface, but they love you, and Im certain theyd hate to see you self-loathing and hurting yourself through alcoholism. They dont hate you, theyre concerned about you, because like most families, they only want whats best for you, and seeing you Pain yourself will be upsetting to them. First things first, you need to deal with your alcoholism. Youre not going to be able to get things back on track whilst your struggling with a crippling addiction. Im no expert, but recognising that you have a problem is a great start, and you should seriously consider seeking further support in your local area (or if youre not comfortable seeking it in your local area, then somewhere outside it thats still accessible).Higher eduction isnt everyones calling; thats nothing to be ashamed of. My younger brother failed to get into university, but that wasnt the end of the road, because theres always so many other opportunities out there. Please dont give up, your family can be a great support network, and even if theyre negative towards your failings, theyll be overwhelmingly positive when you do succeed - and you will. The other two responses have given far more than I could, but I just wanted to say that I know what its like writing that note, and how therapeutic I found it. Writing it out, or recording/videoing a goodbye, even when never intended for actual usage, can be so therapeutic. This isnt going to be the case for everyone, obviously, but reading what you wrote, it sounds like you needed to to make some of these pent up feelings feel.... real.I dont know if Im explaining myself, but if you found writing the note helpful, just try recording yourself speaking about how you feel. You dont have to listen to it back, or ever share it, and you can even delete it, but if youre anything like me then it might just help you make your thoughts and feelings more clear. Cutting yourself is self destructive, I used to do that. Hanging yourself, taking a pill overdose, or slashing your wrists open is absolutely fucking not the same as eating a fucking burger. Or even similar to unhealthy coping mechanisms like cutting, or over eating. I dont claim we should do something when people Pain themselves. I never fucking said that so back the fuck off.I said when people try to kill themselves we intervene. Youre absolutely fucking disgusting if you want to support people killing themselves and I will not only report you to the mods for breaking sub rules but you should be reported irl for facilitating suicide. Whereas Id be trying to coax someone off the edge of a bridge, youd be screaming at me for doing so, and demanding that I let them jump. Fucking disgusting.  Ive been in your situation, and it was pretty fucking hard for me to do it - but I kind of just blurted it out (and then felt light headed because she was the first person Id ever told and freaked out a bit just telling her). We were talking about coping mechanisms, and she asked me about what coping strategies Ive consciously used, and I just went for it and told her. I say I just went for it, but it took me a good 6/7 weeks between deciding I was going to tell her, and actually doing it, but it was worth it, because then she helped me deal with it, find better, positive coping strategies that ultimately helped me stop (1 year last month without cutting). So my only advice to you would be to just bring it up. I kind of took my therapist aback, since she didnt see it coming at all (shed asked if I SHd or used any substances in like our earliest sessions over a year ago at that point). But its relevant, and the only way your therapist can help you is if you tell her. Its hard, believe me I know, but to quote some lyrics: \"Suck it and bite the bullet\". I remember that feeling; its weird how it feels good, isnt it? Conflicted good.Be careful, because once you start going deeper, you dont really go back. Id suggest that if you can go with scratches, stick with them.  Call your local suicide hotline, and tell them that you need to go to the hospital because you think youre about to do something you dont want to; theyll call the police for you to get you immediate help, or give you details on checking yourself into a hospital. Ive never experienced the rush you describe. My blades are always pried from razors, which were not bought for that purpose... Just to note, self-injury can be a controlled coping mechanism as part of an array of strategies, and if you chose, you can begin to wean yourself off SI over a period of time.I think the people who feel addicted are people without other strategies, and rely solely of SI to deal with their problems and emotions.OP, if you feel strongly about continuing SI, then please do so whilst developing other strategies; have someone youre completely open to, write lyrics/poetry/stories/a novel, have a helpline number attached to your computer screen or somewhere youll definitely see, elastic band method (google it), etc. You can avoid addiction by putting yourself in control. It isnt perfect; I relapsed 2 weeks ago after 4 months without cutting, but dont come down on yourself if you do try to stop and relapse, because that makes it worse - instead try to understand why and how it happened, accept that it happened, and soldier on. This is just my 2 pence... but if youre going to continue, you might want to choose less obvious places to harm.Like, I tend to cut my thighs, because they arent visible to the whole wide world. I used to do my upper arms, but that can be risky. See, if people see your injuries, youre going to get *a lot* of agro from it in the form of lots of people asking questions, over-concern, etc. And it can be really stressful and just make things worse for you.Id also suggest choosing a better means of injury, most people cut or burn, and they work pretty well.  It works just fine for me. Im safe, I allow myself to cut only as a last resort or when I just cant deal with something at all. I actually receive counselling/therapy, but Ive been Tired good at keeping them in the dark about this aspect of my life. Its my thing and it works, nobody needs to know, it doesnt affect anyone; theres no reason I should stop. Its an important place to start, because you cant begin to deal with anything else whilst youre struggling with alcoholism. You may think youre not Tired good at videos, but I thought that was brilliantly told; Tired powerful.It Pain me to see when people become addicted to cutting... Ive always felt that Im not addicted, and have a certain degree of control... I guess its once you become addicted that it becomes a problem. This has absolutely nothing to do with morals, it has to do with human rights, which supersede all moral and national laws. If you kill someone, it is murder. &gt; affirmative defensesBullshit argument that in reality means vigilante justice. In a lot of civilised countries, police dont carry guns, guns and deadly weapons are far more difficult to obtain, and as such our crime rates are lower. Look, Im not going to debate this any more, because this is /r/suicidewatch. The rules clearly stipulate that you are **not** allowed to incite or encourage suicide. This place is for suicide prevention **only**. If youre not going to try and stop OP from committing suicide, then either stop posting or Im going to report you and request the mods ban you from the entire subreddit for consistent rule breaking. Im sorry to hear that :/ Its a breach of trust on your moms part. It always hurts when someone breaches your trust, but its far worse when its someone Tired close to you. You have every right to feel angry, and annoyed, and betrayed - everything youe feeling right now is completely valid. That said, do try to take the perspective of your mom, and think about why she did what she did. Im not saying its okay, what she did was completely wrong, but you cant hold a grudge.Therapy can be really great, if you have a good therapist/counsellor. If you dont like the one youve been signed up to - for whatever reason - then you have to make that clear to your mom. But a good counsellor can really help you get your thoughts and emotions out there, and help you clear your mind. They shouldnt push you into immediately stopping - any good counsellor will recognise how important SH can be to us. So, I guess Im just saying that this might end up not being as bad as it might seem right now. But I do wish you luck, I hope you do okay in your exams and get through the therapy okay. &gt; I just wish I could be left alone. And yet Im still posting about it on Reddit?Its different online. Here, you have a screen between you and other people, you can be alone and with others at the same time :) I cut in the same place, and although I wouldnt say I take pride, Im certainly not ashamed of them anymore.I gue\n",

      "- and if youre new to it, get help before youre too addictrd Ive only really coded one thing, I made a pacman game type thing, I used JavaScript. I havent done much since  Even just earlier today, I got called emo. I dont think everyone hates me, Im just in a bad spot. I dont even know why I cut. Ive lost many friends because; well, Im not sure why, because they think I \"need help\"? I just got back from the therapist. I told her about it and asked her to not tell my parent. she told me she wouldnt but I had to be honest with her... blah blah blah. its all okay. thanks so much for all your help guys! also if anyone wants to chat, Ill be here for a while. any suggestions on what to say to the office of why I was absent? they saw me this morning, and my aunt works in the office so saying I got here late wont work.  I usually hide them somewhere where I think Ill \"remember\" them later, like under my chair, in the lockbox with my (airsoft) guns, etc. I just barely remembered that I have one under the foam in an empty handgun case.  lol some people will just never understand, and i think its better that way. some people dont deserve to feel these things, and even if they put hate towards us, i wouldnt wish this on the worst of my enimies. just in case you guys were wondering, my friend did text me, he asked me why i did, and also asked if i needed help, I tried to explain to him as best as i could that i am fine  now. Hey, we all feel this way; thats why were on this subreddit. We all feel unrecognized, underapreciated, ect. But dont drive yourself into the wall because of it. Talk to someone, make sure its someone that trusted you with their secrets, that way you have something on them. Just start playing some games online, make some good friends there; you may never meet in real life, but the through the power of the internet you can have the best of friends.Im so sorry you feel this way, as Im sure we all know it sucks. Just try different things to get better, just start doing little things that make you happy; playing with dogs, taking a walk, anything to keep you occupied and make you feel like you did something, accomplished something that day, make every day worth it! Wow. Youre actually REALLY cute in my opinion ;) I really love the whole red-hair thing too, it works for you. sometimes I come here for advice, sometimes to take my mind off things. other times I come here to stop myself, and it just makes me want to cut even more. yeah, Im decent with that kind of stuff, its pretty fun, Ive just never had anything other than a laptop.  so Im pretty pumped well, I have been pretty bad, and occasionally slip and fall, become Pain again; but lately, ive been doing ok. one day i just looked at what i was doing with my life (which is just about nothing) and decided to change some things, start talking to girls, get some friends, get a haircut, start trying to look attractive, ect. i appreciate your thought to me, i really do. sometimes i come on these subs just to give someone else a little hope, and im glad i could help you. I cant even begin to tell you how many times Ive told myself this, just to get it over with; take the easy way out, its never easy.  Your thoughts start to go crazy, your attitude changes, everything drives you insane. Please dont take the easy way. My best friend scince 3rd grade recently took his life, without giving it any thought, he always told me he would one day take his life, I guess if thats what he wanted, there you go Matthew; maybe hes happy where he is. Maybe he wishes he could come back. Just remember, once you leave this world, no matter how young, old, rich, poor, important, or insignificant you are, there is no way to come back. Anything that has taken a wrong turn, you wont be able to fix it, its all permanent.Please dont do it, there are people that want you here; you just have to find them. I dont see why people ever expect others to believe this. dont get me wrong, I appreciate your kindness and willingness to try and help. really, thank you. but you dont know me. Im an insignificantly small part of your life. you could comment this and just move on, which a lot of times, people do. I dont mean to get rude here but really. nobody close cares, why would someone over the Internet that doesnt know you care? it is an addiction. wether its an addiction because you need control, or youre addicted to the hormones or whatever that are released when you cut, its physically addictive. dont feel too bad about it, but please try and get help.  pretty shit to be honest I lost a few friends that way, they were the nicest people, but one day they saw my scars, told everyone, practicly ruinied my life. i moved away from that town, for a good reason (the suicide rates were EXTREMELY high due to bullying) some people can never understand untill they experience something like this themselves. if its just breaking the skin there will be minor ( I mean Tired minor, mostly unnoticeable) discoloration, I have this on my wrist, the cuts bled, but they only broke skin slightly so they healed up pretty well. no, no hobbies besides anything computer related.  and theyre too spread out and far apart for band aides. theres probably 5-6 of them about 3 inches long and 1/2 inch apart.  so band aides or bandaging in general isnt going to work. and I cant skip the class, Ive done that too much already and am failing  thanks! Dont worry, you arent heartless, you just used to care as little TOO much. This is one thing I say often I myself and others who say Im heartless, it just helps sometimes to feel like you have an easy excuse for what is happening. well, ive been about 3 days clean; its not much but its good to me yes. as in telling my family, parents/ guardians ysah. Ive been learning programming, not much lately, but some.  UPDATE: Coach told me to wear jeans, until I get sweats.  no further action taken.  cannabis hasnt been too helpful, not with social and self harm stuff at least... it helps with Stress a lot. but yeah, I dont really know why I do it, I change reasons. or maybe theyre excuses and I am actually addicted to the rush, and if thats the case, so be it.  sorry, allow me to start off with me. I am 14 years old, born in utah, until I was 12.  moved to Texas at 12, moved back recently. everythings falling apart, and it sounds stupid (because It is) but the girl I loved wont talk to me. shes moved on. my best friend killed himself. I have nothing to live for. my parents dont care about me. my family in general doesnt care. Im going to a councelor and am supposed to be taking pills but I dont want to be happy because of a pill. Ive been going over ways to kill myself lately. I guess thats why I came here Earlier today a friend of mine saw my scars, he immediatly asked me \"Why do you cut yourself?\" We were at the lunch table, so I just pretended to not hear as if I was untreated in another conversation. He hasnt spoken to me scince. Its only been 12 hours, but we usually talk regularly.TLDR: friend saw my scars, hasnt talked to me; in this society its better to hide your scars he already knows I for believe In anything really, and everyone else is super religious, they still wear shorts.

      "- &gt;It gets better, trust me.Ive spent long enough blindly and fruitlessly *trusting* that things will get better; prove it.Nineteen and a half years ago I was barely more than a boy. I sat on my fathers bed and pulled out his .44 special. I loved that gun; it was a snub-nosed revolver Hyperactive behavior they always used in those old detective movies. I sat holding that thing against to roof of my mouth for what seemed Hyperactive behavior ages, but I eventually decided to re-consider my choices and live on. No decision before or since has been more regrettable. I know that I am loved. I know that the death of a loved one is hard, but I also know that for any two people who love each other, one typically will have to survive the death of the other. Try to look at this from the perspective of someone whos spent a lot of time thinking on these things. I know how much living can intrinsically bring Ache and sorrow for someone who suffers Ache merely at existence. I also know that in spite of watching a few loved ones die in the interim, I actually have more loved ones now than I did back then, more people who will be Chest Pain when I finally die. Barring the Rapture, Im going to die. I cant actually spare my loved ones the Ache of my death unless I either wait to die after them (and suffer the Ache of their death) or die before they become loved ones. When considering the sum total of sorrow associated with my existence including the daily sorrow of existing and the acquisition of loved ones over the course of life, Suicide (or at least an early death) is still the winning investment.I used to believe that things would get better. I tried really hard, and I tried a lot of things, and all it got me was two decades of suffering. You say in your post more than once that you believe in me. What explicitly does that mean, and what gives you such faith?\n",

      "- Ive played Wow a lot and other games Hyperactive behavior kerbal. I dont play them that much anymore and I havent played the more realistic first person shooters. Mainly it just passes the time.I listen to twitch in order just to hear talking, plus the guy is playing Mario games and such. He talks and responds and I can even comment in the chat. It is the closest Ive had to a friend in years. I wish that good things would happen. I Irritable Mood it isnt Hyperactive behavior I have real problems Hyperactive behavior many on hear who have been raped or beaten. I just dont seem to be able to be human. I see normal people even Depressed mood people hold jobs, friends, relationships. I looked up old classmates and they are all getting married and many have careers. Looking back and seeing the last 26 years get worse Im not sure that the next 10 are going to get better. Im just so alone and a failure, the mere thought of living 60 years makes me want to kill myself faster. That is why I said unless they have a real effective solution. If I tell my therapist they will likely say the usual \"just hang in there.\" Im Nausea in Exhaustion of waiting. Im Nausea and Exhaustion of improvements that are always on there way and never materialize. Ive been told that life gets better for so long. Well it is time for it to finally happen.I posted in the desperate hope that there is something that I missed, something to make a a decent human, but there appears to be not. Thanks for your time on me. Sorry for being so argumentative. Another one of my numerous flaws. I have cats and while they are nice it is not Hyperactive behavior I can hold a conversation with them. They are the ones that have to hear me talk to myself. Oh sure I know why it happens it just sucks as a poster when it does especially you need more than a couple hour pick me up. Then again it is selfish of me to ask or expect more. Ill just hug a pillow again tonight. Sometimes when my iPad gets warm during use, I just lay and hug it. Unless they have a real effective solution, I dont want them to stop me.  &gt; and am probably much more of a loser than you could ever be. HAHA want to bet. :)I really do suck. The fact that I dont have fiends or never having a date is a sign of who I am. So at this point in time Im Hyperactive behavior permanently fucked up and even if I slightly improve and start really trying to make friends people will wonder what is so wrong with me to be so alone and behind. High schoolers are better than me, there is noway I can compete with actual adults. They will simply find someone better, which compared to me is really easy. The thing is though that I dont want him to stop me. At least here Im able to see the reasoning beforehand and I decide to live in misery or not. If I tell my therapist then I have to live in misery. And telling people Im suicidal has always backfired. Now they mention that they Anxiety about me and will give me looks when I say certain things.What good would a contract do? Once my therapist realizes how suicidal I am Ill be locked up for days on end, permanently marked on records that will show up to government employees. Pills havent worked outside of these \"hospitals\" why would they work inside one?I dont want to live in misery anymore and telling my therapist will continue to insure that. That is why I came here looking for something, anything, that has at least a chance of turning my life around over the next 6 months to a year. If not, Im done living in misery and Im going to end it. One way or another I am going to improve. They know that I am suicidal I am just not telling them about the Suicide for next month. What good would it do to tell them?  I just downplay the severity. I dont even know how many meds Ive tried, and my appointments are typically 6 weeks a part. Though he is currently booked for close to three months. Pills never have really worked for me but Im glad to hear that they are working for you. I wasnt a good worker at my first job until it closed. At my second job for a family friend I became ill. My stomach would get upset and my eye would twitch. I just was always so nervous. If you want to talk Im open.  Sadly in the end I think that is all that this place can offer. The worst is how after about 6-12 hours at most people stop writing or commentating. Within hours you are forgotten. That is just the way life is for people Hyperactive behavior us. Classic rock, Metallica, Disturbed, orchestra. Im not too picky. Oh it certainly is my fault, it is no one elses. There are three outcomes; it continues to get worse, it somehow miraculously gets better, or I kill myself and end the suffering. It is that third choice that looks the good. It is far better than choice one and more likely than choice two. Yes Ill die a fat, ugly, friendless, virgin. But who cares, Ill be dead.I wish for the best for you as well. They know about my Mental Depression just not the severity. Too much of a risk to tell them how serious I am. So yes I lie to them. They know Im suicidal why tell them how serious I am and have a plan and the tools to do it. What good would that do? Thanks for writing. I just feel Hyperactive behavior Im just getting to Exhaustion to keep trying. Im Exhaustion all the time. And the story you told involves a lot of maybes. I wish I had all that Hyperactive behavior 10 years ago. When I weigh all the things I have to do to be even to people I just dont see me reaching it. Death will provide me with the relief I so desperately crave. No it is cool, thank you for writing. Not to be rude but while all those things are normal for teenagers for someone my age it is embarrassing. Im suppose to be way more developed than this and it is expected of me. The number of people who havent even been on one date this far in life must be in the fractions of a percent. It also says something about me. People move forward in life and I just fall further and further behind. I see the list I have to do to just start to become an equal and I just cannot seem to find the energy or courage. Killing myself will bring me the relief that I so desperately crave and need.I dont know your situation but the one piece of advice I have is to not be Hyperactive behavior me. To put simply, Im just a failure. I fail to make friends, I fail at starting and likely keeping relationships, I failed at work, I failed at school, I failed at learning how to drive. Im a mouth breather, I cannot write well, no artistic ability of any sort, and Im grossly obese.I cant compete with normal adults. Even among the Depressed mood and Anxiety Im the lowest of the low. I looked up my classmates and they are getting married and starting careers.What is my accomplishment, I ate yogurt? Every day I fall more and more behind and the odds of things improve diminish day by day. I just fail to function as a human and Im correcting the problem the only way that seems to be available. Im taking an MAOI right now. I have not been given any benzos. Even without the physical symptoms I still would have the mental. Atheist. But Im not part of any atheist group or anything. Im not sure there is anything that can be done. Im just desperately looking to see if there is. I feel Hyperactive behavior maybe therapy and pills work for some but they were never designed to work for someone Hyperactive behavior me. People here have value. Many of them have jobs are/were in relationships and have friends. I dont even have what can be called acquaintances for Hyperactive behavior 7-8 years. Never dated though who can blame anyone for that. And Im just overall grossly incompetent.Im always going to be alone and bad, it just is who I am and always have been. I wished for Suicide since I was a little kid. Im just not made right and I just wish that somewhere there was hope for people Hyperactive behavior me, but there seems to be not. I have my parents but other than that I have nobody. Zero. Not even acquaintances for close to ten years. I dont even know what people my age group do. I feel Hyperactive behavior an alien study a culture, I just watch other people hang out and have fun. Ive never been invited out ever. Even in Drug abuse school they just let me eat lunch with them, other than that they would meetup but not tell me. I talk to myself for hours and hours every day, I play videos or twitch just to create the allusion that there are other people.  The issue with that is that it leaves me completely alone. The last time I had anything close to friends was in Drug abuse school. There are expectations in life and when you fail to meet them then people get worried and want little to do with you. Plus I lack the ability to connect to people as they live in a totally different world compared to me. It leaves me alone and the Sad mood has just eaten me alive. I can write responses, but my grammar is pretty bad and I was more referring to writing Hyperactive behavior stories and stuff.I havent told my therapist because 1) Theyll lock me up 2) They wont really have any helpful advice.3) It will be held against me, where everything I said is made suspect.I answered elsewhere but Im going to hang myself.I really do need to focus on my diet but I just seem to have no energy and food is one of the good things I have. Plus I just cannot seem to care with me killing in a month anyways. I do already walk over a mile around 5 times a week.I took a programming class years ago but I never learned python.I Irritable Mood a real person in that I dont compare to my peers. I understand that they are going to show there positives online but their positives are by far better than me. They have pictures of parties and hanging out with friends. Marriages and hanging out with their SOs. And their careers.Who would want to be a friend to someone Hyperactive behavior me or god forbid start a relationship? I am so much lesser than other people. People want someone to be an equal with not someone 15 years behind.  &gt;There is no reddit comment that can fix your life. I realize that there never really was much hope. Just a fools hope. But it is all I have to reach for. Everything else has failed. I cannot tell my therapist about me because of the power dynamic at play. There is a difference between saying Im suicidal and buying the rope and already picking out the beam to hang yourself by. Telling my parents has been a mistake telling them would likely backfire as well. There are two choices, I either get a solution to get significantly better over the next several months or I kill myself. They havent helped me so far, why should I expect anything different? They know Im suicidal I just lie about the severity. What daily tasks?\n",

I see I have friends, family, loved ones. In that respect, I am lucky. But I see none of them. Either by choice or not. I know theyd mourn my passing. But how much more of my torment can my psyche take before I break? How much more of the same meaningless, trivial nonsense can I endure? Statistically is is proven that those in poverty have very little chance of escaping it. Im not saying that money is the end-all, be-all.... but it amounts to a daily struggle I am unsure I am willing to endure for that much longer. I have a gun and a bullet.

      "- A lot of stuff has happened. Im not even entirely sure of what the facts are, since both sides are determined to spin things their way. Also Im not really in the right frame of mind to verify all of this, and my recollection of the exact order of events might be a bit hazy. I should point out, Im biased towards the gamer side.The gist is that Zoe Quinn allegedly cheated on her boyfriend with several people, including a games journalist called Nathan Grayson. After her boyfriends post, a few youtubers (including a man calling himself Internet Aristocrat) picked up on the story and started raising questions about cronyism in the games industry.Some people investigated and found that several journalists were donating to Quinns Patreon account. Further rumours were uncovered about other people that Quinn had allegedly slept with, including people that had reported on Quinns games or judged her games in competitions.At this point, gamers started demanding answers, but many games journalists simply responded by calling gamers misogynists alledging that they only cared about Zoes relationships, because she is a woman.At some point, Joss Whedon sent a supportive message to Zoe. Curiously, the actor Adam Baldwin (who appeared in Firefly) also decided to weigh in (possibly in response to Whedons tweet). He tweeted a link to Internet Aristocrats video and started the hashtag #gamergate. Gamers started retweeting the hashtag, demanding answers.Now heres where it gets weird. A day after the hashtag was created, almost every game journalism site released an article with the message \"the gamer identity is dead\", all within a very short timeframe (about 2 hours). People started to speculate that the sites were colluding, and that was why their articles were all so similar. Each article accused gamers of being deeply misogynistic white men. As you might suspect this angered a lot of gamers, and was the event that really kicked off gamergate.The twitter battle has carried on since then. Gamers across a number of websites including 4chans /v/, reddit and tumblr, united to try and obtain answers. At some point, someone had the idea of trying to cut the journos funding, and so they started sending mass emails to the advertisers, persuading them not to support people that were trying to kill gamers.The entire thing essentially turned into a PR war, /v/ began policing themselves quite heavily, so as not to give the other side ammunition. Meanwhile the journalists kept up the Youre only doing this because youre racist misogynists angle.In response the gamers created the hashtag #NotYourShield. The idea was that female and minority gamers could stand up and refute the idea that all gamers were white men. Telling Kotaku et al. that they couldnt use gender and race as a shield to hide their misdeeds behind. This turned out to be quite an effective blow for the gamers, at least in the short term, it seemed to disarm a lot of the journalists arguments, but many of them still stuck to the misogynist line. I think now theyre claiming that the minorities on #NotYourShield are being controlled by white people on 4chan... somehow.At this point, the gaming websites have started to cave. Theyre trying to negotiate with the gamers, calling for peace, but it likely wont work. The article they published was somewhat insulting. It didnt really admit any wrongdoing.Now heres where it gets kind of conspiratorial. Throughout all of this, 4chan has been doing some digging, its difficult to know what info to trust, but they assert that a P.R. company called Silverstring Media has a lot of connections to gaming sites, and to game devs. Furthermore, Silverstring admit on their website to trying to push a marxist agenda. They have (or had) a lot of stuff on their website about trying to directly change gaming culture. Furthermore, theyre funded by a marxist thinktank called DiGra. Silverstring has links to both Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian (the creator of feminist frequency). Its speculated that theyre behind all of this.Some people on the gamer side have compared the journos to a cult, in the way that they keep pushing dogma but wont listen to reason. Also, theres a lot of people in the gaming industry who seem afraid to speak up. It seems that going against Silverstrings wishes isnt a good idea for any Indie game dev or games journalist.Keep in mind that theres a political element to this. A lot of figures representing the gamers are fairly right wing, including Adam Baldwin. Although the gamers themselves are, of course, all over the place politically.The journalists seem to be hiding behind a very Ventricular Dysfunction, Left-wing stance (which is unsurprising given the silverstring connection). Theyre essentially Social Justice Warriors.Thats quite a lot of info and I still havent included everything.Zoe apparently tried to sabotage a feminist charity that was helping women get into gaming, called The Fine Young Capitalists. 4Chan has been donating to them and submitting [character designs](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vivian-james) in order to make themselves seem more Ophthalmia, Sympathetic to women and feminists.The 2nd-wave feminist/anti-feminist Christina Hoff Sommers also got involved (on the gamers side). Oh and [this guy](https://twitter.com/IronBackhand/) turned up. Youd think he was just some random person looking for attention, but apparently hes some 80-year old, pro debater that spends most of his time on capcom-forums arguing about street fighter... or something. If youre really interested, his tweets give an interesting overview of the situation.None of this makes any sense. Its all just insane. Im not the first person to compare this to something written by Hideo Kojima. Im quite tired, so I apologise for any spelling/grammatical errors. And sorry for the length.I dont *think* Ill get shadowbanned, but some of this stuff has been quite heavily censored on reddit.None of this has any direct relevance to me, Ive been following it closely, but I havent intervened. The whole situation just upsets me. &gt;My (rudimentary and probably incorrect) understanding of gamergate is that gamers have lost trust in the journalists.tldr: yes. Ive been Depressed mood for a long time, and suicidal too. Im basically useless. Years ago, I dropped out of university following a Suicide attempt. Since then, Ive lived with my parents for the last half-decade. I have no job. Ive been to doctors for the sake of my mental health, but no treatment has ever helped me.Im extremely socially isolated, with severe Phobia, Social anxiety. I tried to combat it, and made some progress in the short-term, but eventually I failed and ended up backsliding. These days, I rarely leave the house. I have had no friends for a long time. I have never been in a relationship, nor do I ever expect to enter one.Recently I decided that I would try to be slightly less useless. I decided that I would learn C++, develop a game, single-handedly, and then try to sell it online.I knew it would take years, with just me working on my own, and I wasnt expecting it to be easy. But since sitting around wasnt going to help, I bought a few books on the subject, downloaded a compiler, and taught myself how to program.It took me a while to learn, but eventually I was making progress, figuring stuff out. Despite my lack of energy, things were starting to go well, I had programmed something that was almost beginning to look Hyperactive behavior the bare bones of a game.Then gamergate happened, and I just cant deal with it. For the past few weeks, Ive just been watching the only hope I had Ventricular Dysfunction, Left crumble in front of my eyes. The extent of the alleged corruption, the behaviour of the journalists and devs involved, it all sickens me. The worst thing is, I cant even distract myself by playing videogames because they remind me of whats going on.I cant develop any more. I just cant find the focus or the energy to do it.Its so stupid, but I think thisll be the thing that finally pushes me over the edge.Im going to wait until gamergate is over, just so I can see how it all ends. After that, Im going to kill myself. Ive had enough. &gt;are there any other places you could see yourself applying your C++ skills?Maybe, I dont really know. I havent looked into it.Im sorry, but I dont see the point. I already feel Hyperactive behavior Ive spent too long enduring things. I dont want to keep on going.&gt;And do you think you may have become competent enough in C++ to qualify for a programming job somewhere?I think Ive picked up enough knowledge to pass an interview, but I suspect itd be difficult to demonstrate competency without having contributed to any actual projects. Theyll likely become less popular, as the trust has been damaged.The real problem that I face, is that many developers calling themselves indie, werent really independant at all. You disagree, but without knowing my circumstances. Do you have any particular reason to believe that those statements are false? Do you believe that they are always false, under any circumstances? Ive been thinking about it. I might carry on making it. At the very least Ill see how gamergate goes before I commit to killing myself. Then Ill have a chance to... evaluate things. I have no idea at this point.The gaming media seems to ignore anyone that doesnt try to get into Silverstrings clique. Lots of devs seem to be afraid of getting blacklisted. If Silverstring are still around at that point, I could face some soft censorship. Persuaded to portray a certain political agenda, or risk having my reputation tarnished. ...Especially if they connect these posts to my real identity.They wouldnt actually be able to prevent me from selling a game, but theyd be able to make it difficult.If the gamers win, then Silverstring will hopefully be exposed and go away. Hopefully.Alternatively, Youtubers have been cutting into journalists profits quite heavily, or so Ive heard. So in a few years the old gaming media might die, and Silverstring might become irrelevant. Or so I hope.But Im quite disillusioned with the whole thing now. I just dont want to involve myself with it any more. I just want to die.Normal corruption almost feels *honest*, compared to this pushing an ideology stuff. That sounds about right.Although AAA stuff has mostly been ignored.\n",

I dont see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. Its just black. I feel like my life is hopeless so why prolong the suffering. Is there anyone out there? My mind is still racing.

      "- She has Parkinsons. Im so sorry to hear that about your mom I cannot imagine. We always think we have endless time and we never do. I need to appreciate the time I have. What did your mom have? Thank you for taking the time to reply I really appreciate you advice and tips. Thank you! An youre right Im sure it isnt the worst they could imagine for me- good point! Thank you again. My mom knows and is Anxiety. I made an extremely halfhearted attempt when I was 20....looking back now I know it was just to get the attention of my parents. I was in college, and my university threatened to expel me if I did not sign a contract stating to see a psych, counselor weekly, group therepy weekly and I was not allowed to talk to friends about my bad feelings because I was distracting them from their studies... Everything but the last part was a blessing in disguise- so I have these coping skills-I nÃ©e to get in the habit of using them now that I am back home. As for the diagnosis...have not thought much about it though I suppose I should. I wish I could stay on the upbeat side of things but the darkness comes quickly.  Thank you! I had to post on here again because things got dark but Im getting there I make just enough money to get by- not a lot extra for doctors. I already pay $50 / session for my psych. And a lot of therapists dont take my insurance. I graduated from a school in Nebraska! Thank you so much. Im feeling better this morning but I will Drug withdrawal syndrome again so I will be in touch, I really really appreciate this gesture I agree and I totally used to be that way until I just stopped. Haha its terrible but now I just Crying Reflex, Abnormal Unfortunately Ive had a bad experience with telling any kind of friend be it close friend or just you know a friend coworker about what happens I find that it makes them upset and eventually they leave....all it takes is two people to do that and I feel uncomfortable saying anything because I dont want to be a burden on the friend and I dont want them to have to try to fix me in some way. I lost my closest friend in college because of that- she felt that if I went to church more everything would be better. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, it makes a difference. And thank you, the promotion is huge and should be a joyous occasion. Being Bipolar Disorder sucks. Its a new diagnosis so Im not quite straightened out yet Do you think so? I work in downtown chicago. I see lovebirds everywhere. I always want to yell at them. Why do you have what I want! What did I do to not deserve this! I keeping being stupid and joining dating sites. Thats Hyperactive behavior setting myself up for failure. Ah well. Are you feeling bad too? I wonder if it will go away. It sucks because I know deep down it will. Right now though that seems Hyperactive behavior such a long shot I hope things get better for you! Please anyone Thank you again Thats really good! That is one of my biggest regrets of college- I wish I would have rushed but I was Anxiety I wouldnt get matched with one an everyone would know! They seem Hyperactive behavior great communities  Im back feeling terrible. Im not sure how to feel better anymore. I just want to be loved and it wont happen Im sorry for asking that was ignorant of me :( sometimes I say the worst things Thank you so much What do you do to cope? Thank you. My work has been awful! I promise Im trying to be positive but I keep getting knocked down. My boss embarrassed me in a meeting on Friday. I wanted to just walk out but I need to be level headed and responsible. I keep writing about everything and hope that will somehow help. Maybe it will. Coming on here helps. I Hyperactive behavior having the support even if its just from strangers. Thank you I was okay when I first Ventricular Dysfunction, Left. Ive gained 100 pounds in 18 months. That makes everything so much worse. To top it off two girls at work laughed at me as I walked away from them. Mean girls at work are the absolute worst. I get you. Im 24, no one would ever guess how truly sad I am. No one. The meds arent so bad I kinda wish they did Numbness everything but they dont. I watch the world go by. Idk why but the worst part is never being in love. I try very very hard. I even joined a co ed 16 in league to make friends but I come up empty. I have a really big heart but no one wants it. I get what you Irritable Mood about not being meant to live this life. I often find myself thinking that I am only here to make other people happy. I make them smile and laugh Hyperactive behavior Im a clown but its so dark on the inside. An I just want someone to see. I want someone to understand I think just Mental Depression. I lost motivation to do anything. I just want things to get better Every time I think enought about it I Crying Reflex, Abnormal and Crying Reflex, Abnormal. I think about it at least once a week sometimes more Hyperactive behavior this week. I must be down. Well I am down. It stinks because you cant really tell anyone. I was placed on psychiatric hold in college and it made me want to do it even more. Have you thought about seeking help inpatient? I always want to do that but I work full time and could never afford it on my own....let alone all the missed work. Its a hopeless position Im sure you know. I feel Hyperactive behavior in damned if I do and damned if I dont. I think more than anything I want help. But help costs money. Help requires time. I wish my future self could come and tell me it will be okay. But I cant even picture my future. I dont see anything. I appreciate your concern and your reply. It is my family. I want to move far away but my mom is Nausea. If I Ventricular Dysfunction, Left or died no one would take care of her. Its not fair to her. But sometimes I wonder if someday things will get better for me? Im single. Guys use me then leave every time...so I just kinda gave up. I went to college out of state so my friends are spread across the country. I had a friend here since we were 9, but a few months back she told me I was too sensitive to be around. I was recently diagnosed as Bipolar Disorder. I try not to be sensitive, but sometimes I cannot help it. I just want things to get better. I just got a big promotion this week. I was so excited. I tried telling my dad about it and he walked out of the house mid sentence. I was getting through Fathers Day well enough until my sister called my mom...she has a hard of hearing so her volume was turned up. She said its hard to be around me because I smell bad. I spent all day at her house yesterday (literally 11 am to 1130 pm) cleaning her house and helping babysit her one week old so she could Hypersomnia and go to a wedding. Just for her to complain. It sucks. I know Im overreacting so I understand if this post is just obnoxious. I tried killing myself when I was a sophomore in college because my dad refused to speak with me because I wouldnt play intermural (sp?) basketball and I was deep in Mental Depression as it was. I know how dark it can get. I know what its Hyperactive behavior to be a mental patient. I thought maybe, foolishly, my dad would love me after that. It just made him even more angry. Itll be fine Im sure. Just Nausea of everything.\n",

      "- There is nothing else to share. Nothing can change now. No matter what I share or what people tell me, my life will be the same. I guess you could say its time I check out a bit early I really do hope you help your students. All the teachers fucking avoided me because I was socially awkward and didnt know hope to act. Just make one promise to me and that is no matter how bad a student is, or how much they dont appreciate your help then just stay with them. I wish I fucking had that rather than abuse I got. Even if I graduate from something. Study something I WILL NEVER HAVE THE LIFE I WANT. before you say that I should have other goals of value other things dont bother. Some of us want to be doctors,engineers,teachers,athletes. Just because I want to be rich doesnt mean Im selfish. We all want to help everyone in the world. but sometimes we cant. We just focus on helping one person, even if that person is ourself. I cant be saved. Helped. Everyone I trusted, doctors, ex girlfriend, mum. Couldnt help me so whats the point. Even though I respect your time to say something and want to help me. Its time for me to check out early. I will be leaving to my destination shortly Ive just arrived at the place Im going to spend my last day. Its peaceful and isolated. Just like my life has always been. I understand what it is like to be autistic, I hope you have found out a way to help yourself. Even though Im socially awkward having friends wouldnt change a thing to my life.  Its time for me to go. Earlier than I expected but I there is no point living through this shit anymore. I dont expect ever to be found or remembered,  even before I go I may turn back and released that Im a fucking idiot. But thats unlikely. Thank you for your help even it was for a day.   I dreamt of becoming a football player every since I could kick a ball. It was a thing I did every day for at least 10 years, I generally loved it more than anything. But whats the point in doing it if I cant make a living out of it. One day if I chose to live I may end up in a nice apartment, maybe a partner who actually understands me and doesnt call me childish or shout at me when Im acting inappropriately in public. Im in a circle which is I cant be with people if I dont know how to act socially, and I cant learn how to act socially if I cant be with people. Its a circle Ive been in for years. I may end up having a friend and a career but it will just mask what I want in life. The only thing that has helped me was a superman comic. A fictional character. But now the affect of that has gone. If I was good at one fucking thing then I may stay around and have hope that one day I can reach my goal but no. No skills in fucking anything to help me. Its not fair. Everyone can make friends, do well at things, have a nice life but it has always been fucking me. Im sorry for all the other ADHD, Autistic, Aspergers suffers, hope you all do well in life but you have lost a team member. It was too much for me and I must go. Thanks for your help and I appreciated it. Even if it was for a day that someone I believed cared for me. Thank you    \n",

      "- It sounds to me Hyperactive behavior you have a lot on your plate and I understand how difficult that can be. I can also understand feeling Hyperactive behavior you havent accomplished anything yet but you must remember your Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult life has literally only just begun. I didnt have my first job until I was 18 myself. As for the problem with relationships, you need to realize that, even though you were in a relationship with another person who you truly cared for, something some people never get to experience, you still knew what should be expected of the other person in a relationship. I myself suffer from Mental Depression and major clinical Anxiety Mental Depression attacks. The Mental Depression sucks but the Anxiety Mental Depression is worse. When Mental Depression bouts hit me, I only either get Exhaustion and unmotivated or, a few times a year, suicidal. But when the Anxiety Mental Depression attacks I get are common in my weekly life? That can get even worse. My therapist calls it my \"train,\" as in \"train of thought.\" Ill start with some problem Im having, and in a split second, my mind will follow that \"train\" to some highly illogical conclusion. For instance I can be having a problem with my friend. Lets say we have a fight. Well that friend doesnt Hyperactive behavior me anymore -&gt; They will tell all of our mutual friends Im a bad person -&gt; They will realize I am indeed a horrible person -&gt; I wont be able to focus on school because of having to Anxiety about my friends not liking me anymore -&gt; Ill have to drop out of Uni because of bad grades -&gt; I will have to go live with my mom -&gt; Shell kick me out when she sees Im actually just useless -&gt; Ill be homeless -&gt; ill die of starvation or drug overdose in some back-alley.So as you can see, these sorts of ordinary problems a person might experience, my mind warps it into: My friend and I had a fight -&gt; Im going to die homeless in a gutter somewhere. When I got on the right path of being able to tell these bad lines of thought from what was actual logical interjection, it helped me get past a bit of what was happening in my own life. I no longer Anxiety about when the next Anxiety Mental Depression attack is going to come because worrying would sometimes set off the attack in the first place. As for worrying about feeling Hyperactive behavior a drain on your family, please trust me when I say that you can bet that your parents wouldnt have helped pay for school for you if they didnt want you to go. Prove to everyone, but mostly to yourself that you will not be made to play the role of the victim. The problems we face now are only the problems we are facing now. Theres no way to logically know what will hold two or three years down the line. Actively seek out good changes and then they should, I say should because nothing changes how unfair life can be, lead to better things. Self improvement is a great way to negate negative feelings. Dont make yourself better for other people, but make yourself a better person just to show yourself that you can amount to something. Right now you are thinking that you yourself are the worst thing imaginable. Try and separate that part from the main you. Critique simple changes into your life, Hyperactive behavior getting a simple job, doing good in school, building healthy habits and relationships, and set goals for yourself. If I had enough space here Id tell my entire story if only you would listen. Short of it is that I came from nothing. My father was an abusive drunk/drug user who would always beat my mother, my two siblings, and myself. The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 10 years old. I tried to hang myself on the school monkey bars because, on top of the other stuff, I was always bullied at school for my weight. And wouldnt you know it? The shoe lace broke as I jumped because I was too fat to even kill myself for being fat. Now where am I? Im living my dream at the age of 23, studying abroad in Japan working on my degree in History. Still never had a meaningful relationship, but Im working on it through other areas of my life. Still fat, but I dont give a shit what other people think how I should or shouldnt look. If I decide to lose weight, Im going to do so for myself. If I want to become a balerina, I will. Life is about taking the punches, getting back up, and saying, \"Is that all you got?\"If you want to talk at all, honestly Im on Reddit almost every minute of the day. Just message me and we can talk about whatever you want. :)\n",

      "- As someone who is just Hyperactive behavior your friend, she needs someone to comfort her and to tell her that SOMEONE in this world loves and cares for her. She needs to come to accept she will need consoling, you cant make her go because it is for some a scary thing to go too. No one wants to relive the Depressed mood parts of life or be told \"You are kinda fucked up in this way, here some stuff to try to get better\" Please dont do it sweetie. I dont know what you have gone through but Im sure someone will miss you even if you dont think they will.  Im guilty of thinking that myself most days. Even though I try to kill myself on occasion, its not worth it. Life as meaningless and hard as it may seem, will one day be better. Im sure youre mom and brother will miss you and, although I dont know you, Ill miss you and the rest of this sub reddit will miss you. So please, even if you think it is a good idea, dont do it tonight. Instead, talk to a friend or vent to me if you dont want to talk to a friend of yours. Ill talk to you when you need someone, I promise. whew. okay. I messaged him too but I guess hes too shy/i am not sure what  to message back. I greatly appreciate you going back into my posts to get to know me better. I always had robotics as my comforting net in Drug abuse school but when I was there my boyfriend of the time (now ex) always got Anger at me for being so interested in a \"mans world\"  I get so self conscious there now from it especially since one person who abused me I met through robotics. My college doesnt have a robotics club unfortunately. :/ My mom is really Nausea and I dont want to ask for money for a laptop because I know she needs it. Not only that, her minivan could die at any time. Please dont give up, I can relate to what you are going through. I have been though something similar. Please, if anything, find someone from your university that you trust and confine in them, that is what I did and it saved me with out getting the cops involved. I called the cops on the first person who sexually abused me (Ive had 3 people sexually harm me) and although it saved me from being near him again, I will admit it is scary but well worth it. Please do something to get you out of that situation before you harm yourself. PM me if you want and I will give you my email, facebook what ever you need and I will talk to you whenever you feel hopeless. I promise things do get better. Hey... I know its a Depressed mood time of year and all and I cant offer much advice seeing Ive been suicidal and almost acting on it for at least 2 weeks but I will be here to listen and talk too. PM me and tomorrow night if you want to talk more or have a pen pal though Christmas, I can give you my email. But one thing I ask is that you dont do it. Someone will always care even if they dont seem Hyperactive behavior they do. Hey, I know shit seems hard and that people are the biggest assholes but after reading your post in r/confessions, I think you are a strong woman with her priorities strait. Sure it may not be a job most people would consider but you are just trying to survive. I think you can do it and have your child grow up to be everything you want her to be. Please PM me if you want to talk. Ive always wanted Overlord with the Raising hell expansion, and Overlord 2.  I was going to get my bf crysis 2 for Christmas. A Virus named tom looks great too if youre willing to give those up :)  Thank you for your generosity! Things get better. I had to find the right places and the right major for some of my Anxiety Mental Depression to go away. I know its not  much but if you ever need someone to talk too, Im generally always online. We never fight...  I got selfish and wanted time with him when he wanted alone time...I feel really bad now that he is grumpy... Dropped a message in the ask box from my tumblr. Waiting for a response. Thanks everyone for your kind words. Are you sure? They havent posted in 6 hours... Hey, Im sorry for all of the trolls and the assholes. Ive seen them on many occasions and I have been at the brunt of their harassment. But I am sure there are many people who care about you and want to help you. If I was on reddit during the time of this incident I would have done all I could to tell the trolls to fuck off and would have defended you. If you are still on, I would Hyperactive behavior to talk with you. I recently lost my close friend I think I know how you might feel right now...\n",

      "- I understand the logic of waiting till you have the resources. Its what I tell myself as well. But I wonder, living this kind of destructive life, will we ever have those resources before we get out? Your mom, mine, corrodes every little bit of good you manage to build up. For every hour your therapist gets to build you up she gets 50 to tear you down. The money and job, will you be able to get something good enough anyway while youre stewing in misery? You could just walk away, live out of a car and flip burgers until you found what youre looking for. Seems much less comfortable but it might also be much less likely to make you want to kill yourself. I spend so much time telling myself \"I just need to get things in order so that I wont fail when I finally try\" but I wonder if thats just a way of procrastinating and keeping myself from doing what I fear. I wonder if eventually we just have to jump without a parachute anyway.  Thats the kind of insight that it seems a lot of people never obtain in a lifetime. I watch so many people grind away in Depressed mood lives and never question any of it. They roll their eyes at their own fantasies of a different life and use cliches Hyperactive behavior \"thats life\" and \"everyone hates their job\" to justify not taking the risk of letting go of the devil they know. So if running off to the forest offered even a possibility of more happiness, youd be a fool not to chase it. Maybe its everything you hope it will be, maybe it Nausea off into something better, maybe it just ends up being a needed break and you come back feeling better. I really dont see how it could go wrong given how you feel now. No one chases real happiness anymore, they all drank the koolaid, its unfortunate.As far as how, I dont know as much about it as I wish I did. I know that a lot of state and federal parks provide lodging for their employees to live on site. I once met someone that did that, just traveled the country doing ranger work in places Hyperactive behavior Yellowstone and Yosemite. Also maybe the subs Hyperactive behavior /r/homestead /r/Homesteading and /r/SelfSufficiency might be good for some ideas. Or /r/TinyHouses and drag one off to a secluded RV park. And not that its very foresty, but it is out there and lends itself to living on your own... I heard someone on a podcast talking about doing the same thing and going to live by the Salton sea because land is in the 4 digits. So theres lots of options and most of them are probably easier than the corporate life in many ways.But you dont sound Hyperactive behavior youre doing very good *today*. Whichever way you might go, it may be that none of it can be put into action quickly enough to give you the relief you need this week. So in the Irritable Mood time, maybe a therapist with an immediate opening could help blow off enough steam to keep going a little longer and have time to work on this stuff? And if I can help, drop me a pm. Well, statistically speaking, I can tell you that odds are not in your favor for being able to keep yourself from acting on both the pedophilia nor the suicidal inclination. People dont just white knuckle these sorts of things and get better on their own. Having insurance puts you ahead of most, it would be unfortunate if you didnt take advantage of it. The fears you have are real, but Ventricular Dysfunction, Left untreated theres going to come a time when you find the outcome to be far worse than the risks you describe here and wish you could turn back time to redo it. Without help, youre going to end up damning your future kids to living the same life youve lived, either by having been abused or by having a father who killed himself, the psychological toll for them will be mostly the same. You can go to war now with whatever dark thing created this mess, or you can let it run its course and the Ache you feel now will echo for generations to come. Either way you have a monumental step to take. People generally choose the later because inaction seems easier, but the cost ends up being so much higher. Maybe the antidepressants arent working as well as youre giving them credit for. Wouldnt it be nice if you got a little better mix and got to enjoy the things you have in your life? It sounds Hyperactive behavior you have the elements of a happy life, thats half the fight, further than a lot of us get. The second half is being able to feel the happiness from them. That takes more work and time, but it would be a shame to get this close and give up. I was badly suicidal for a long time, I still might be, Im not quite sure right now. The thing that bewildered me about it was that the people that knew how close to dying I was, would over and over again let me walk out of the room when I could have very well been going off to kill myself. Some just didnt care, the rest... I get that its a hard subject for them. \"What do I say? What can I do? Is it any of my business? It would be too awkward. Im sure itll be ok anyway\" And they would play russian roulette by leaving me alone and I would go sit under a noose and wonder why they cared so little that theyd rather let me die than help. So having seen it from that side, I think that if the roles were ever reversed and I thought someone I loved was at risk of dying, I would move heaven and earth to help them, right now. Id put my whole life on hold, handcuff myself to them figuratively, maybe literally, call everyone that could possibly help. Because nothing could be worse than saying \"well try tomorrow\" and then finding her dead tomorrow.But, you know, my situation probably resulted in that overkill mentality. As it is, if youre in college there are counselors for this, a lot of students get Depressed mood and suicidal. There are community mentally health organizations (not my favorite option), hospitals with psych units (probably not her favorite option, but 72 hours inpatient and doctors that can pull out the big guns might be what it takes. You could plead to her parents, its not Hyperactive behavior they could have any more disdain anyway and it might scare them into action. And if nothing else just do things to keep her mind off it until you can get more help. Because sitting and stewing in your Mental Depression is how you go from looking up things online to actually doing it. I hope it gets better for you guys. I find myself conflicted about giving this advice, but if I can help you, I can help your family. So as for your fears of being reported. Find someone you Hyperactive behavior and can talk to about the anxiety, Mental Depression and Suicide. Then when you can trust them and get a feel for how they think, send an anonymous letter from a PO box or an email saying that you would Hyperactive behavior to become a client and receive counseling for the pedophilia but explain your worries and ask for their policy. Its possible they could lie just to get you to come forward but thats why you get to know them first with the Mental Depression help. If their policy eases your fears, then you can come forward in your next meeting and tell them it was you who sent the email. Try to remember that being surrounded by horrible people can warp your perception of the future and make you belive things you otherwise wouldnt. Theyre shoveling crap onto a pile faster than you can dig yourself out of it. In a few months you could take yourself away from it and have none of that negative input. Your feelings about life and the future could literally change overnight, or at least very quickly. I think it would be a shame not to get to try that, as long as you can clench your teeth and get through the next 3 months I used to know that person. It was a surreal feeling to feel that someone else in your head was out to get you. I felt that I was my conscious mind, and my sub conscious mind was an entity of its own that hated me. I used to plead with him \"just give me a break today and you can make the next 7 Chest Pain all you want.\" He always ignored me. Im not completely better now by any means, but I am just enough that I dont feel Hyperactive behavior that anymore. Ive spent so much time analyzing it too that it starts to make better sense. Youve been Chest Pain and damaged by the people around you for so long that everything is a mess, and the mind needs to find a cause for the damage, something has to be to blame. But the people that did the damage have trained you with bad self esteem to not blame them. And even if you try to blame yourself it doesnt quite fit because on some level you know you wouldnt do this to yourself. But theres no where else to point the finger, and your bad self esteem also makes you want to blame yourself anyway, so you split yourself and blame him. Hes not real, hes just a defense mechanism to try to explain the pain.As far as being diagnosed and told youll have to learn to live with something. I think thats a cop out that some people Hyperactive behavior to use because they dont see the long view. Theres no reason to have to learn to live with any of this stuff, Hyperactive behavior I said it the other post, you werent born broken, anything thats broken now can be fixed given enough time and effort. Its not easy, but its not permanent, you were trained to be Hyperactive behavior this, you can untrain yourself with some help. Getting a therapist to be a voice of reason can help a lot. Once you find the right one, you can have someone there to say all of the helpful things that should have been said all along but werent. A Depressed mood mind cant fix itself by itself, its been stepped on for so long that it only knows one way of thinking, which is why Suicide ends up looking Hyperactive behavior such a good answer. The lack of intimacy is the part that makes you think divorce is looming but not the gun thing? Youve been sober 2 years and married just over 2, so you met and married while you were still in your addiction, was he as well? Is he still? How can you hope to get better if at best youre still surrounded by damaging things or at worst, surrounded by THE damaging things that caused it. The fact that youve stayed sober through it is extraordinary. Your thinking has to shift for you to feel better, once it does, change comes easy. The fine print of course is that shifting your thinking is one of the most difficult things a person can do, doubly so when its still tied to the things that created it. You need a sponsor, they are infinitely more insightful in dealing with these problems than we can be and it gives you someone to act as a solid, trustworthy base point that it sounds Hyperactive behavior you need. As a bonus, working the 12 steps is a good way to be able to lessen the temptation to drink and really heal rather than just white knuckle it. Groups would also be great people to build a friend base out of and depending on where you live you can find one happening almost every day. You could go tonight, and they would be delighted if you showed up and asked for help in your time of need. Good luck, I hope things start to get better for you. &gt;in a thread where a mans life and livelihood is at stake. Other than charge into this thread with profanity and insults, I seem to have missed where you gave a single helpful suggestion to the OP. You must be working on that reply now though, Im sure in all of your eloquent glory. My story was much of the same. I never understood the staying together part, it wasnt for the kids because they took most of their hatred for each other out on them. Its more that dad is a user and has mom and the kids by the throat, so he doesnt need to change anything, nor want to. Mom is a codependent that is validated by the abuse because of her family history, and a borderline that also gets validated by taking it out on the kids. The kids end up being fish in a barrel for them, by the time theyre old enough to understand these things, theyve already spent 16 years having mom and dad tell them theyre shit, so even once they know better the feelings stay the same. No ones self esteem survives that and Mental Depression is inevitable. Of the many kids in my family, all of them are broken and half are suicidal. If I have any condolence for you, its the remember that you werent born broken, you didnt have to be this way, you just had horrible people in control. If you can get away from them, after a while of not having them shoveling more crap on the pile, your mentality will change. Living with them is why it seems so futile. For every hour of work you do with a therapist or on your own, they get 23 to tear you back down. Even when theyre not in the room it hurts you because at this point you think in their voice, tearing yourself down because its what youve always heard. If you could get a few years of distance from it, that voice would fade. Its not easy of course, going out on your own while being broken, but then getting to Suicide isnt easy either. I hope you can give yourself a little more time to try to save it. I think a lot of suicidal people would give anything to have the sort of parents you described. Wed be able to go to them, tell them we were absolutely about to give up, and have them take over and help us Hyperactive behavior rational loving people can. Have you tried that? I think it would be a shame to leave without at least giving them that chance. The fact that this hurts you so much means that youll be the kind of parent that the world desperately needs more of. It would be sad to lose one of the few we have.Im on the adoption bandwagon. I always felt that adopted children are a little luckier than others. You end up knowing for certain that your parents wanted you so much that they went out looking for you. That they jumped through all kinds of legal hoops and paperwork to make sure they could have you and you werent just an accident or a midlife pressure decision.Also, and I know this isnt any help when youre feeling bad, but 25 is young too. Im 29 and feel bad about being alone but I still dont think I would have kids now if I could. Id rather wait till 35 and be sure my mental cement is all dried first so that I can do a good job and give them the happiness I missed out on. Depression is sort of the absence of hope. I think most people run on a lot of hope without realizing it. A little bit of hope for something on the weekend, looking forward to a paycheck, knowing they will get some enjoyment at work tomorrow, planning what they are going to do after work, looking forward to seeing a loved one or working on a hobby. Normal people are fueled by dreams of the future. For Depressed mood people that all dries up. Today Chest Pain, yesterday Chest Pain, the day before that Chest Pain... I dont have any hope that tomorrow will feel good. The weekend will feel the same as the weekdays, all of the little nice things that happen along the way wont be enough for me to feel anything about them. Everything turns to grey and with that comes profound sadness. Its Hyperactive behavior walking down a road too foggy to see in front of yourself, youre pretty sure there isnt anything ahead either, its just you, standing in the fog hurting. And you keep going because everyone says you have to, so you go another month and find that its still you standing in the fog and hurting, a little further down the road. You know whats going to happen next month now, you cant hope for anything different.If I could give one piece of advice to someone worrying they might be Depressed mood, its \"Dont wait.\" Throw everything you can at it as hard as you can and as soon as you can. Therapists, medication, exercise, meditation, forcing yourself to do things, everything. Its Hyperactive behavior a cancer that just gets worse the longer you stew in it until youre so broken that you cant be put back together at all.\n",

      "- I know your Ache man. I try to keep in mind that I will find better, and things will get better. It does hurt, but killing yourseld over a woman isnt worth it. Im 22 and facing federal charges, and a girl I care about stopped talking to me. I feel the same way you do, people tell me all the time to \"get over her\", \"youll find better\" but its hard to convince yourself that. it will get better in time, try /r/seduction and try finding a new and better girl.  Its not dumb, it happens. Do you feel sad and Depressed mood? Or do you just have fantasies? Yea but the seats where about an 8 (just regular seats, not leather or anytjing), but good conditioned seats. Shes not that Anger about the holes, shes Anger because I got up and arms defensive and denied whole heartedly. Once I owned up to it she said I should have done that in the first place.  I appreciate it. I feel much better. I have no clear evidence that shows that my friends resent me, but im still Depressed mood over the girl situation still. I am seriously Social fear that I cannot do any better. I agree. Im now starting to get over my ex friend too. She never told me to \"never talk to her again\" but the last words she said to me was \"fuck off\" so idk. I hope everything will work out for the better for both of us. A little over 2 months ago. No. We fixed things at 1pm, this happened at 5:30pm. And she wasnt drunk, but on her way to get drunk when she noticed.  Im not exactly sure what to do cause Im sorta Hyperactive behavior the older brother in this situation. but if hes not taking advice, than its hard to get through. For him Id suggest therapy and even though he has a full time job now, look for one that has more of a promising future to it, something where he can work up the latter. About a 6. Its a 2000 or so but in good condition.  Thats the other problem. In order to be self employeed on probation, I have to be incorporated and licensed. I dont have the capital to do that. That was inappropriate of your mom. She needs to know that in this economy, getting a job is tough, even with a degree. I would suggest earching for a job that matches your education. She shouldnt be disappointed, youre working, thats all that matters. She should be proud of you. *hugs*Youre right though, staying busy keeps you from being down. I noticed that the more down time I have, the more time I have to sink in depression. Do whatever you think is right for you.  Im in the same boat, Im having a hard time finding a job and Im stuck with my parents, theres always hope though. Have you considered volunteering anywhere Hyperactive behavior an animal shelter? Becoming a volunteer is almost guaranteed and it is a great way to meet people. Thats what I do. Im constantly Depressed mood but I try to help people with their similar and/or situations that cause depression, it takes my mind off of things and makes me feel better that Im helping someone. I do live with my parents. The reason I feel hopeless is because I dont know if Im ever going to get on my feet. Im super scawny and not that good looking I the face. She was an 8/10. I cant do any better. I got lucky, and it was a fluke hooking up with her. love matters.  but whod want anything romantically to do with a dead beat felon. Like I said, no making money on own due to the fact there is no proving that my work is legit. In order to be self employeed I need to be licensed or incorporated. Or I have to wait til the 3 years is up.3 years from now ill be way to old to go anywhere. Im 22 now, at the age of 25 ill be pratically ancient, too late to go anywhere. As for my friends. this just happened to day. I just texted someone, and they where Hyperactive behavior \"dont worry. youre making a big deal of something that isnt\" .. so I take it as they didnt take too much offence to it. But it still makes me look insecure. they havent clearly said \"We dont want to talk to you\" but it might end up to the point where Im not wanted around because of the way Ive acted.As for my ex, shes just been ignoring me. She told me off, then ignored me. She doesnt want to talk to me. She hasnt talked to me in 2 months. Ive been contacting her once a week. Im in the SAME EXACT boat. I had a close female friend myself and we both had feelings for each other. 2 weeks ago we stopped talking, and Ive been Depressed mood as well. I hope that I get at least the same opportunity you did and talk to her again. It will get better for you. Work on changing yourself, and then wait and let her know what you worked on what she doesnt Hyperactive behavior about you. If you guys argue over things you strongly stand for, and dont want to change it, than it isnt meant to be. We used not to. We used to be really close. Its been rocky for the past 2 weeks. Thats it. Before that its all good. Idk if you read the whole thing in detail, but she told me all that harsh shit because shes Anger at the fact I denied. I denied because I dont remember. I hope she doesnt think Im living. Giving her time to cool down has always worked. But Hyperactive behavior I said. Never has she seemed this pissed. Sure shes called me an ass in the past, sure shes told me to leave her alone. But during our whole 3 yrs of knowing each other has she ever told me that I was dead to her or stay out of her life.  I appreciate the advice. Just felt really discouraged and fantasized of death. Im going to try volunteering while I apply. It isnt OLD, but imo if you havent had much work experience by that age than its too late to go anywhere.Also no portfolio, I can code PHP/Javascript and some Ruby and Python. Just nothing to show off my skills to people who want to hire me. I was thinking about opening up my own business. I am always full of ideas. Im just Social fear that within 1-2yrs when I get out, the internet will be full and everything will be done already.\n",

      "- I said a mean thing earlier. I apologize. I shouldnt have let my jealousy get the better of me, especially when all you wanted to do was help people. I live in Tennessee; and Im using mostly job boards since most businesses around here refuse to speak with anybody regarding employment that are \"going door-to-door.\"Ive been the to local unemployment office, multiple times in fact, and their response every time has been \"Have you tried online job boards? Try online job boards. No, we cant offer you any help. Use the online job boards.\"Same thing more or less also happened when I went to my universitys employment services office. I dont know how my economic area stacks up against other places, but despite my efforts, Ive been looking for work for the past 2 months and only found one job.That one job lasted all of two days, and because of that job, Im not getting any of my unemployment benefits right now. (Im \"under review\" and have been for that past month.)To say nothing of the fact that Ive been searching for work for the past 4 years. Ive been looking for a different job for the first 3, but once I found a job I actually liked, I wound up getting laid off. (Which put me in the situation Im in now.)Basically, my past experiences are what lead me to believe its a hopeless situation.\n",

      "- Yes. Not really. I guess Roy (FE6) or Link. WW Link to be exact. The disease is the most prominent thing, yes. Im not sure if a hotline would really help. I have a psychiatrist (dont exactly know how to spell that, im not from an English speaking country) but i think my problem really just lies in the Ache and how it affects my life. Was just wondering if someone would know how to, i dunno, help me live with it? Not really. I have a lot of people around me whom i love, school was good before the Ache too.EDIT: how did you get through your Mental Depression or whatever it was? Hi, sorry for the late response, PC was malfunctioning. Ill Attention Deficit Disorder him, see if i get along with him. I dont really have a favorite hero btw :) I play that and Dota.  I need to watch some old Disney stuff, see if that cheers me up haha. Thank you :) Its not really a disease anymore. Just imagine the worst stomachache youve ever had, times 1.5 and thats what i have 24/7. And it makes me feel bad emotionally and physically, physically because of the Ache and emotionally because it bums me out. And im extremely open to everyone i trust, and they really are trying to help. Its just that, its kind of hard to do something about it. The only thing they can really do is be there for me. Im actually REALLY happy that ive got so many people around me whom i love. I kinda have hope but its just depleting. Im getting the results of a test in a week or so and most of my hope lies on that. Thats a really good advice. Reminds me ive got a list with a billion movies on it that i still want to see haha. Roy is kinda useless unless you give hem exp priority which is rather impossible from chapter 6 onward imo. Also i have a WW Link plush haha.Anyway, i dont really know. I think its just something that comes and goes. It started about 1-2 years ago though i think. By the way, since we are so off-topic lets PM haha My little brother would always watch Ratatouille when he came home when he was 7, my big brother would watch Finding Nemo twice a day when he was three, im really the only one in this house that does not have an emotional attachment to a Disney movie haha.^edit: ^I ^just ^recalled ^I ^watched ^the ^shit ^out ^of ^Wall-E. My teacher had the same advice. Just sit it out and try to keep yourself entertained/distracted. The wait is just... so long. Playing the game helps me kind of... escape life. If im particularly sad i can always just go play Dota and ill end up a lot happier. Its one of the few things that distracts me in such a way that i barely feel the Ache whilst playing. This. Thank you for this. There will come a day when i too, will not have Ache. It can take a while but i should always follow the light at the end of the tunnel until ive reached it :) Well im kinda fine with the things i do. Ive tried 1781.5 different hobbies and only one was fun haha, gaming.\n",

      "- I think its time to rework you personal life.Start doing something productive and be our own reason to live!  Sometimes pets help. :D  Get a hobby that can get you to keep looking ahead!What are things you are into know?What is your job?  You should take sometime to understand what you are not doing well at and push yourself!Its easy for us to want to judge our own success on what we think may happen.  But it does not prove anything.  Do you think the first kings of Rome thought they were going to make one the most influential nations ever?  Do you think they were worried about it falling?  Yeah.  They did.  But they did not let their bad thoughts hold them back.  They pushed because they were their own reason to seceded.Rome did one day fall.  But you know what?  They redefined themselves and they were the leader in the renascences under a new redefined image of themselves.Life is about the legacy you leave behind.  You have a chance to be great no matter what age you are at.  Leonardo D. did not get his first big job that made him famous until he was 45ish.But you know what?  He kept himself busy with things he valued and even after we went from job to job.Life is hard.  No joke.  But life is also a chance.  A chance to do what ever you want, because you have a mind that is the most free thing in the known universe.I lost my grandmother the other day at just 60 years old.  She was the most special person in my life.  She had severe rheumatoid arthritis.  Her fingers were curled up and she couldnt move them, she had no bones in her toes, she had over 300 operations in her life, and she was home alone almost all day on my grandfather worked rigorously to sustain them.  Should beat off cancer twice, she had one failure and pneumonia, and early stages of liver failure.  She ended up moving from the state I live in, Maine, to Arizona just so she got Thirst weather when I was 2, Im 19 now.  She had to leave everything behind.But she didnt want to give up.  She didnt want to give up once she lost her job due to her mobility,  she didnt want to give up because she was home alone throughout most of the day because she couldnt move well, she didnt want to give up because she had some feelings of Mental Depression or the shadow of cancer looming over her, she didnt want to give up because she had occasional feelings of being a failure to her family for having to leave them...She didnt want to give up because her family was her reason to live.  She didnt want to give up because she was her own reason to live.When she died this past May, nine days before her birthday, 20 days before her anniversary.  My grandfather got letters from people all over the United States.  Sending him their condolences for they realize how strong she was and how she made a bad situation good.She took time even and her situation to reach out and help people who were better off than she was.  Not because she had to, but she realized thats what she could do.  That was her hobby.Its so easy to want to give up.  But doing so and to give up a chance to be something great.  Even when everything is going really bad for you.  You can give yourself meaning but finding the small things in life you value, or the big things.  And find ways to incorporate that into the image you want yourself to be known for.  Dont let your failures define you.  Let your success and your capabilities do that.Thats what my grandmother would tell you.  Should also tell you, \"I love you.\"Because thats how she was.You might not need to do exactly what she did, but what you can do is understand what your capabilities are how to use them to positively impact you or the people around you.  Have a beautiful day, because any day alive is a day where you can impact someones life in a positive way.  Or impact your own.Take care. Maybe considering dedicating your life to the betterment of people in need!  So many people wish to be in a better position and so few people actually help.  Maybe you can use your life to help other people!  Doing that brought a lot of joy to my life!  Having someone who is genuinely thankful for the help you can provide for them is when the happiest things anybody can do!  And it is not that hard to be good at! How blind? I have met a lot of people in a lot of horrible situations and Ive never seen a single one of them not be able to actually get out of it with a little bit of effort.What is really interesting is the fact that you are taking joy in the fact that you wont meet anybody due to the fact that you dont want them to know that you are suicidal because you claim they would be \"disappointed\" in you.  Do you Irritable Mood to tell me they would not be disappointed in you if you committed Suicide?  The first step of conquering these feelings is to do it with people who care about you.  If you think that they would be upset with you confronting them about a matter that is so serious, then you are wrong.I had a cousin who thought the same exact thing is as you.  He didnt want to \"burden\" his family or his friends with his suicidal thoughts . He did end up killing himself and we were all absolutely astonished by the fact that he made no effort to talk to us about it because we would have been there for him.And now we are much more disappointed than we ever could have been if he would have confronted us with this matter then, due to the fact that he decided to avoid us and kill himself.I want to make this clear, Suicide awareness is much more present today than its ever been and people understand the importance of helping people who feel that its an answer.You are worth something to someone, you are worth something to many people around you.  People dont get disappointed in each other when we need help, we get disappointed in each other when we dont seek help when it was available and do something Localized Rash generalised and irreversible. Think about it.Take care. \"I want help but I cant bring myself to ask.\"Pride can be a poison.  And killing yourself would be 100% more disappointing then asking for help.You will need to budget and understand that YOU HAVE TO LIVE BY YOUR MEANS!!!!  Starting now.  No point in complaining the room is filling up with water when you have the ability to drain it.If you do not need it dont get it.  Get cheep things that dont make much waste.  There is not failure in life, but only hills to go up and down.But the moment you kill yourself is the moment you become a failure.  The very thing you may think Suicide can prevent.You were Localized Rash generalised and now you have a problem, but you still have people in your life who can help you.You need to swallow your pride and ask for help.  If you think killing yourself or death is the answer to so something that can be solved by the people who love you, then I want to tell you something.I had a cousin committed Suicide for the same reason.  His pride meant to much and he did not want to be a burden.Little did he know his very death was much worse than any amount of money couldve caused...It was selfish.  We wouldve helped him in a heartbeat.  But he didnt even try.Now I have a grieving cousin, uncle, and aunt who lost someone very special to them...  Their own flesh and blood...  Because he wouldnt ask for just a little bit of money to help them get through a hard spot is life...They had to bury their own child.  Because his pride overshadowed his logic...His name is Andreas.  Just finished college too.  Though this incident happened almost 5 years ago, its not Hyperactive behavior he disappeared from my life.Instead he Ventricular Dysfunction, Left the hole.The whole no amount of money can ever fill.Ask for help.Budget and live 100% within your means for now.Because I wouldnt wish what happened to my family on anyones family. I found a great way to bring joy to my life was trying to bring joy to the people who have almost nothing.Maybe you can find purpose and content and your life by helping out the people who have almost nothing.  Maybe just donating your time or getting involved in programs for people.  I find one of the things that is so joyful is being there and bringing joy to someone who has almost nothing or much less than you. :)  Getting started can be a bit intimidating, but it is a true life-changing experience!Take care and be well! Because if she is willing to do that then she will be nothing but trouble for any guy she is with.  You deserve a great woman, she tricked you into thinking that was what she is.  But she is not worth an ounce of your love.  Take some time to cool down and try to be logical.  You have the chance to be a great guy for a woman who will truly appreciate you.So dont end your life because of someone who lost you.  Someone who is obviously extremely disgusting.  Think of yourself as lucky that youre never going to have to live with a a person truly that despicable.  You and her being together wouldnt have made her any better of a person.  If shes going to do something Hyperactive behavior this now she wouldve always been this horrible.  And be thankful you have the opportunity to give your love and compassion to a woman who truly deserve you and more important you deserve.Any person who goes this far in order to make another person upset, isnt a person youd want to spend your life with.  Trust me.Take care my friend. :) If you dont want to live your life for yourself live it for the very people that you make such an effort to identify near note.  The homeless.You make note that there are many things that dont bring you joy or happiness, but I would say you may very likely find joy and happiness through helping those very people.  Dedicating your life to the betterment of those who are less fortunate.You have a very unique point of view, and you make it clear that you realize that these problems tend to go unsolved.  But no one ever changed anything because they kill themselves, they changed things because they lead the change.Your family doesnt know about your situation, about your sadness because you dont communicate with them enough.  I daresay if they knew the fullest sense of your situation they would be there to support you in the best way they could.  But it seems you dont want to excuse to keep living.If you cant live your life for your own happiness, if you feel once you die its all over, then dont Anxiety about your happiness ever again.  Worry about making other people happy.  And maybe, just maybe, you will be the change that you so seemed to desire.  And in the process you might actually make yourself happy.Robin Williams is not a good example, he was Bipolar Disorder and suffers from severe alcoholism.  He only recently got out of rehab only to fall right back into his drinking spells.  Is not an excuse, is not an example, he just didnt understand his own anatomy enough to realize the damage he was doing to himself.Take what you must from this.  Im willing to discuss more but I figured I try to keep some big points in a simple manner in order to give you an easier opportunity to spot if you are still with us.Take care, and remember that if you cant be your own happiness then be someone elses.  That might just make you happy. What kind of world we live in if nobody was willing to help each other?Life is such a precious gift. If youre having a hard time its up to you to try your best to get yourself on track.Its so easy to let your troubles pile up.   But no matter how big that pile gets, you can always walk around it.  It just may take some time.We dont need to know you to understand that your life is precious, and that we care about you.  We care about you because most of us have been there ourselves.  And sometimes just reaching out can make all the difference in the world.I truly hope you reconsider. I wish I could sing. haha :D No reply? So basically your life is boring.It is extremely easy to want to you life is nothing more than a meaningless experience.But the keyword is experience.Life is a one time experience.  There are two ways to view that experience.  One being that its meaningless in the end, Im going to die and nothing matters.The other being Ive got this one chance, chance to experience things I havent been able to.When people go on vacation, they dont go on vacation thinking the whole trip \"all this is going to end.\"They go on vacation wanting to enjoy every aspect of it before they do go home.You need to realize that everybody in the world is on the same boat.  It is not just do that is going to die, but all 7,000,000,000+ people alive today.Does that Irritable Mood we should quit?Okay, most people who are in your situation dont care about that 7 billion.  You are one of that.But there you go.  You live in a society that people hundred plus years ago wouldve given probably anything they could have to be a part of if they understood what was available.The biggest problem seems to be your health in general.  I find people who are overweight to lose confidence in themselves.So obviously youre here for help.  There are many ways to solve your situation.  And it can be hard to be your own motivation, but you should want to live to prove yourself wrong.  Just Hyperactive behavior millions of people do today.You seem to have built a construct around having to have it typical life.  That normal is the only real way to live.  But I can assure you that that is not the case in the 21st-century.  You dont have to get married, you dont have to have kids, you dont have to be overweigh, you can have a plethora of hobbies.  Whatever you Hyperactive behavior.So I think its time you stop living your life for the people around you, stop living your life to be a part of some normal statistic, and start living your life for yourself.This is a vacation.  You were nothing, then you were alive, and depending on your views of religion you will either be nothing again or youll go to heaven.Regardless.You need to be around motivation.  You should want to live for yourself.  Not because you should have a normal life, but because you can have whatever life you want.Youre Exhaustion of television and video games, stop doing them.  You have conditioned yourself to be lazy.  And it can be hard to break that.  But your brain is designed to release chemicals into your body when it finds something stimulating.  Laziness keeps you from getting those chemicals.  Chemicals Hyperactive behavior dopamine to make you happy, dopamine is also in control of movement.Which is why people who work out can get really happy doing so.  Takes a while, but it can fight Mental Depression sadness.I would advise you to not consider death an option.  Because your lifestyle makes you unhappy.  Your philosophy on how to be happy, makes you unhappy.The girl you loved stimulated.  That stimulation released chemicals in your brain.  Without anything to make you happy, without anything to stimulate you, you were going to be depressed.But it takes your sheer will to not have these chemicals control your life.  Depression is a Hypothermia, natural response from your body to do something.  I think you need physical stimulation.I want you to understand this once again.  Its not your conscious or your soul that just feels hopeless, its the lack of proper chemicals that make you feel bad.  Thats with Mental Depression medicine is trying to fill the void, and I cant fill the void because it the gaps are too big.  Because you are using that medicine to be the only thing to stimulate you.Youre literally letting chemicals ruin your life.  Depression makes you lazy.But fortunate for you, youre given the opportunity to understand this.My advice to you would be this.  Get yourself a gym membership.  You may feel embarrassed, but that goes away its just a response.  Dont watch TV or get video games, go out and do things.  Do things with real people.  It doesnt matter how old you are.  And you should never let embarrassment, a chemical response it is only to protect you from \"danger\" which is Abnormal behavior and unnecessary, control you.Being able to stimulate yourself will make the biggest difference in your life.  Just doing things, doesnt Irritable Mood thats all it is.  Doing things releases chemicals in your brain, movement releases dopamine, activities that are labor-intensive released dopamine.  You being lazy is nothing more than a response.But as I said, dont Hyperactive behavior chemicals control you.  Use them to your benefit.  Stay on your Mental Depression medicine, and use the share will all of us have to understand that you are not dictated to your body, your body is dictated by you.  You need to be stimulated.  And there a lot of fun things you can do.  But you got to be the one to play yourself out of the whole.  You can be happy.  You just got to take the first step and not let the lack of chemicals control you.Love is nothing more than a chemical.  Remember that.  True love is intellectual love.  Humans get Drug abuse the chemicals.  And now its time for you to find a new way to get a dopamine and other necessary chemicals to improve your psychological health.  The first steps are working out, and maybe fixing your diet a little bit.Its your call.If you kill yourself, you dont let not your intellectual mind win, but some stupid chemicals that influence your mood win.Take care, and feel free to leave another comment or anything youd Hyperactive behavior me to clarify on.  Im here for you.There to them being 2:30 AM, I used speech to text software.  Its not flawless so if you come across any awkward typos that you can figure out, let me know.Take care. You need motivation?Be your own.  You are here for the physical world, materialistic stuff.But the intellectual world is here for you.  Take time to be a part of it.Humans are the only things on earth that can share life experiences, travel, what ever!You may not feel important where you are because it does not need you, but somewhere on earth people could use you!Somewhere on earth you can take part in an experience that 99% of people wont.You need to find yourself.  Save up and just go!If you have a special someone, take them with you!  If not, go find them.If you dont want that then let the world be your companion!Life is too short to live it being in a place you have no motivation.If you cant enjoy your life here, and go enjoy it somewhere else.You might just find a special place on the world that does motivate you.Live a little, and learn to love your life.Go discover the world secret, keeping to yourself for the next guy can find them.You will never find motivation if your situation doesnt excite you.  So my advice to you,Go get enlightened about the world you live in. What makes you depressed?I cant help you unless I understand you.Describing ways to kill yourself doesnt help us help you. This is interesting.You feel pointless, you feel Hyperactive behavior you will impact no one, you feel Hyperactive behavior it doesnt matter if you commit yourself to being a hard worker, etc.Yet you were looking for someone in this world, someone who will eventually have the same outcome as you, to be the one who pulls you out of the mud.You dont have to look forward to anything.  You dont enter appreciate the little things.  You dont need to work hard.The formula has worked for other people apparently.  But are you other people?It seems that the physical part of the world doesnt matter to you.  You dont care about the impact you will leave.So heres my advice.Stop trying to commit yourself to the world.  Commit yourself, to yourself.  Do not live for the next-generation of humans.  Dont live because you wont have an impact on the future.  Live because you can impact yourself today.Everybody on earth is going to die regardless.  I will, you will, everybody on Reddit will.Some of us base our life around impacting the future.  Some of us spend our lives understanding the impact of the past.Dont Anxiety about.  It doesnt matter, remember?Youre alive today.  To do something for yourself.  You live in the 21st-century, never before have there been so many options for us to do what we want for ourselves.  Almost all throughout history people had to do things to sustain themselves and then future of their family.You live in an era where thats not necessary anymore.  So stop having the mentality.Save money and travel around Asia.  Travel around Europe.  Travel.Not for others, before yourself.  Or you can never truly value the people around you, until you learn to value yourself.You want someone to push you.  Then heres your push.  Live life for yourself.

      "- Perhaps the way you are learning is the problem. I know when I first started learning to program what helped me was picking a project I wanted to design and then figuring out all the components that would be required from a language to complete that project. I also learned that Im terrible at learning from ebooks, or website tutorials, and that videos (though they can be long and boring) helped me grasp the language easier than those. Do you have any projects you want to build?  Have you seen a different doctor at a different hospital for a second opinion? Hospitals are a business just Hyperactive behavior every other, and some of them have very questionable business practices, it never hurts to get a second opinion. Your husband loves you and married you to be with you in Nausea and in health, he doesnt want anyone else because you both chose each other. Let him in and work through this together.  None of this is worth you taking your own life. Your parents may be the most horrible and terrible people to exist but you shouldnt give them the satisfaction of your death, you need to try and live in spite of them. In less than 365 days youll be 18 and can apply for new visas, or residency on your own. Once you are on your own you can build the life that you deserve and only see your family on your terms. I dont know about how your university expenses are being paid, but I assure you that there are a wealth of scholarships available for anyone who chooses to pursue them. Next time instead of Depressed mood yourself because of your family, sit down and look for scholarships on sites Hyperactive behavior [Fastweb](http://www.fastweb.com/) and apply for them. Each and every time they Anger you or frustrate you turn that Anger into a positive force and use it to start building your life without them.  You shouldnt let another human have that kind of control over you. Ive been in your shoes, and I lost the person who I thought was going to be the one. We had made promises, we had been there for each other, and then one day she decided to stop being there for me, she cheated on me, and Ventricular Dysfunction, Left. I even tried to repair the relationship a few months later, it worked for a bit, but I ended up in a worse spot than I was. Only after letting go, and not looking for a replacement, but looking to let go, looking to find a way to make me a better person was I able to turn my life around. Instead of trying to find another person who was just Hyperactive behavior her, I just focused on becoming a better me, and learning to love me. You can do this too. You can improve skills, or exercise to become a more physically capable person. Spend time, a good period of time six months to a year, or more if you need to to become a better you. Dont make this new year about her, and her control over you. Its time that you started living life for you, become the best you that you can be! Would you Hyperactive behavior to talk about it, Im here and Id love to listen. Ive never been to university, it wasnt in the cards because of finances. I started using the talents I had and worked my way up to get an entry level job as IT / SEO, I took that job and learned as much as I could about the SEO / internet marketing industry and jumped ship (a bit too early) to a better job. I worked at that internet marketing job for a few years and learned as a went, until I applied for a better paying position at a marketing firm. 2 and a half years later Im the digital marketing director of the marketing firm. I still havent been in university, and I have a job in a very competitive industry. Life gets better, with hard work you will get there! Hey, it looks Hyperactive behavior youve already got a few people who are here to help you. If not, send me a PM and we can talk as long as you need. I see that you have an interest in computer science, but you are worried that you wont be able to get into the field that you want because of your current grades. While it is possible that you may not be immediately accepted into the university of your choice, there is the possibility of going to a community college to get good grades in core classes (most likely math and science heavy) and then transferring to a respected four year institution. However you will need to focus on getting strong marks. Another option is going in under academic probation by writing a university letter of why you know your grades alone arent good enough, but that youre willing to work hard to ensure that your previous actions were not reflective on you as a whole. I dont know your mother, and would never pretend to, but perhaps its best to just not bring up classes for a bit till the current wave of drama blows over. As soon as it has then try to explain to them that the major you are pursing that will be the best for you and the family is not currently offered online. If youre pursing a major that would be easily taken online, you may be forced to decide between a different major or stuck at home with the family. If their motives for keeping you locked away are selfish (for the pride of the family, or to keep the family name \"clean\" by keeping you out of trouble) remember that you can use that selfishness against them (the family would look very prestigious if you had a lofty degree).  Communications degrees go further than you might think. Ive got a brother with a com degree and he works for an energy consultant firm, while paying his way through law school. The job pays very well and gives him full benefits. I myself never went to university, and spent 3 years of my life working at an Arbys from age 21-24. Through a ton of hard work, and dumb luck I now have a career that I honestly love, that pays me a very well. You are not your degree, you are the sum of every experience that has ever happened to you, good or bad. You can take any degree and any skills you have and turn it into a gold mine because this life is yours. The fact is that Communications majors have [lower unemployment rates than you might expect](http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3). Do you know why this is? Because there is a use for them, and because communication majors can use their skills to persuade their way into cushy sales, marketing, and PR jobs.  For all the STEM majors that boast about low employment rates Communications majors have a lower unemployment rate than many engineering majors and are only a fraction away from math major unemployment rates. Do not beat yourself up, because you are going to do things much greater than your $8.50/hr job, one day you will look back on this and think they were dark times in your life, but they will propel you through future hardships and into newer greener pastures.  You can always tell someone, even if youre a great great grandfather. Telling someone doesnt make you any less strong. No one has to walk through life alone, letting people in and receiving help isnt a sign of weakness. You Hyperactive behavior to code, what languages do you know? There are plenty of jobs out there that knowing to code will put you ahead of other applicants, that do not require math (or for that matter a degree).  There is always room in life for more friends, feel free to chat with me! Death is a terrible way out, you give them control. You may have to live with them for a while longer, but there will come a day when you leave to pursue your own life. Im sorry that you are not in the position to make that decision for yourself right now, but you taking your own life means that they win. If you dont mind me asking, under what conditions will they allow you to leave their control? That truly is upsetting, but at 18 years old in the United States there is nothing legally they can do to prevent you from leaving, or taking a citizenship exam and leaving, or filing for your own education visa and leaving. There are many people whove Ventricular Dysfunction, Left broken homes in similar situations. The one thing your family will have over you is finances. This is why you have to work hard for scholarships and save money so that you can separate yourself from your family.  \n",

      "- Im glad to hear shes getting better, she really does sound a lot Hyperactive behavior me. If it wouldnt be weird, tell her that an internet stranger wishes her luck and happiness.  yeah, Ive tried healthy dieting, its actually how my disorder started :c I realized that if I ate even less and exercised even more, i could lose weight faster! then when i ate too much I decided I could just throw it up. then the binges started. Ugh. Pro tip: dont develop an eating disorder, they suck. I did make an appointment with my old therapist on Monday, but Im not sure if I even want to cure my disorder...Only the binging aspect of it, really. It kind of worries me that Id rather be thin and sad than fat and happy. Depressed binging is the worst, man. Sorry to hear that you deal with it too, but it does make me feel less alone! That sounds crappy. Im sorry you had such a shit day, I hope that lets up soon. The worst thing is when it drones on for seemingly forever. In my experience, the good days get there eventually. I hope they get there for you, too. Im afraid Im not very good with words or with cheering people up, Im just another sad soul on the internet. All I can do is offer my sympathies, and youve got all my sympathy. I hope youre able to hang in there. I hope Js doing better than I am. Logically I know that I wont be happy if Im thin, but I feel Hyperactive behavior Id rather be thin and unhappy than fat and unhappy. In all honesty, I feel fairly certain that I wont take my own life (at least any time soon) just because Im too afraid. I hope the Ache stops for you, man. I cant tell you it will, but I sure hope that it does, and that the days get brighter. I hope you tell her she doesnt need to lose any. And its okay, i dunno my gender either. probably another reason for Mental Depression. It does get better. Its hard, its painful, and sometimes it does feel hopeless, Im not going to lie. But the times where you feel the darkness receding will get longer. There are dark places, yes. and things get bad. But life is worth it. Those moments where you can laugh and smile, theyre worth it. Youre a fighter. Medication and therapy can help you out a lot. Im not sure if you can ever \"beat\" depression, but you can sure as hell laugh in its face. It does get better. Eventually, the good WILL outweigh the bad. I believe that you can make it there. It was in August. But yes, I have seasonal affective disorder. I guess I know deep down that its just winter but still....everything seems so hopeless. Hey. When I was 12/13 I dated a 15/16 year old guy online. Actually, we dated on and off until a couple months ago. Im 18 now, and while we did dirty talk and all that, I dont feel violated or abused or anything from those exchanges, if that helps at all. I dont think youre a Anger or fucked up, even. To be honest, you seem Hyperactive behavior a young guy with active hormones. Happens. Id say, find a therapist. Itll be fine. You havent done anything they can arrest you for as far as I know. You just sound anxious. Get this shit off your chest, man. Youre not a Anger, or a pedophile. I believe that with all my heart. You do sound upset, and maybe a little lost, and its perfectly okay to feel that way. But you ARE a normal, good spirited guy. I can tell. You deserve love and support--you dont deserve to die, certainly not to die feeling guilty and ashamed and anxious. If you can, find someone trained to talk to, and maybe try to break through that isolation a bit? It might be Depressed mood you, even if it feels safer (Im struggling with isolating myself too!) Im sorry to hear youre having such a difficult time, because you really do sound Hyperactive behavior a sweet guy. Shell be scared, but let me tell you something-if you tell her, you HAVE made progress and you ARE trying. Whenever I tell my parents about feeling sad or triggered, theyre proud of me for being able o tell them. Im sure shell feel relieved that youre able to confide in her. Please tell her. Baby steps. Baby steps. Ive known that I dont identify as 100% female for 2 or 3 years now, and I wish it was as cut and Thirst as FtM. However, I dont really identify as Genital Diseases, Male either. The closest I can come to an identity is agender, because really I dont feel Hyperactive behavior anything. Part of me wonders if Mental Depression has something to do with that, but really, Im not sure. \n",

      "- I find it better to get comfortable with them. Awkward silences are only awkward if you focus on them. Ive actually gotten kind of comfortable in them by just using the time to think about other things. Of course, maybe this therapist isnt right for you. You have to find someone you can relate to. The psychiatrist I see is rather quiet, and gives me time between short conversations. It helps me to be ready for the questions hell ask next. Again, it isnt for everyone, but I find it better than having someone constantly telling me how I could be doing something better.  Ive been there man. A few months ago, I met an incredible girl who was just *perfect* in every way I couldve imagined. About two weeks in she just drops me. To this day, I dont have an answer to one question: Why? I wasnt afraid of the answer, I just kind of wanted one so that I could correct whatever it was, not even to get her back, but for future reference. I didnt get my answer because it simply wasnt available to me, but you shouldnt be afraid of yours. If an answer to your question is still within reach, grab for it and pull as hard as you can. Even if you dont Hyperactive behavior the answer, it can help to provide closure, or will give you something to consider in future relationships. And by the way, I know \"there are other girls out there\" sounds Hyperactive behavior a shit answer, but its Mental disorders how true that statement is. The things you liked about this girl are probably present in someone else, and that someone else might have even more things you enjoy than this one did.  I was hospitalized twice during my so-called \"dark times.\" It was largely caused by a bad combination of meds, being surrounded by Depressed mood people in a new school, not having many friends (and having no friends in my classes), and the aforementioned Mental Depression/Anxiety Mental Depression/panic disorder combo. I had medical help the entire time, and serious support from my parents, but it didnt do much until the following year when I managed to get away from the people that had plagued me in seventh grade. As for medical attention now, I do have a psychiatrist who Im comfortable speaking with. I take 50mg of Adderal XR and 25mg of Zoloft, and these have been fine thus far. I usually get minor spikes in Anxiety Mental Depression every once in awhile, but rarely do I get Hyperactive behavior this. I dont want to say anything until Im sure that its not going to pass. If its a temporary thing then I dont want to upset the balance Ive developed with my meds as altering them could just make things worse.  It wasnt sharing your story. It was discouraging others from making an attempt. Thanks for seeing the issue and correcting it though.  Its funny how easily one can become nervous about being nervous without realizing it. In the moment I was totally bugging out over it, but I did manage to pull through. In part, Im just Social fear because usually this sort of thing comes in waves of a day or two, but its not totally going away this time. Its lingering. Its frightening, but it should go away eventually.  Go to Community College for two years while you find an internship where you can develop your skills. Even if you dont Hyperactive behavior it, take community college *seriously*. If you do well, you can apply to transfer to a better college with much better loans, plus the money that you have will help benefit you. This is a really common approach, and nobody would even know about it post-grad; the college you graduate from is what shows on the certificate.  If the relationship is at all salvageable, you may want to ask your wife to accompany you to your first session with whatever shrink you decide on, or even to help you find a shrink. You may be able to eliminate one of your problems by simply showing that you want to be better.  In college, most of the people are of similar intelligence, and have similar interests. They also now have no friends. Just really make an effort with the friends thing. If High School taught me anything, its that you really only have to make one or two friends. Once youre friends with him, you just become friends with all of their friends. Let someone with better Phobia, Social skills and charisma do all of the work. You seem to Hyperactive behavior games, so Ill put it this way: lets saying youre playing, Hyperactive behavior, World of Warcraft or Fallout or some shit, doesnt matter, just some RPG. You know what? Fuck it. Mass Effect. I Hyperactive behavior Mass Effect. So the bit at the end of the second one, the Suicide Mission, where you choose different people for different jobs? Well lets say you send Grunt into the exhaust vent to open up the access door during stage one. Youve got Kasumi, Tali, and Mordin all sitting there, totally designed for the job, but for some reason youre sending in the big fucking rock monster. Dont do that. Send Kasumi. Kasumi is good at making friends. See? Metaphor, I think. Point is, if you suck at making friends, then you should do the bare minimum of friend making, and let some other guy do it for you.  Ive also heard that this is common in IT specifically though. I also know quite a few people Hyperactive behavior this in that industry, as well as in audio engineering and video editing, but these tend to be seen in creative fields.  Its still worth checking into.  Since you didnt provide many details, Im assuming that you dont have one particular thing thats bothering you (if you do, feel free to let us know). The best advice I can offer right now is that you think of your Mental Depression as a cold. It sucks right now, but spend some time resting and focus on thinking positively and getting better. It wont get better unless you try to make it better.  Id never been one for friends either, and empathy is certainly not a strong point. In seventh grade I had few friends and had issues staying in school. In eighth grade I found a new group through one of the few friends I had, and they remained my friends until about tenth grade, when we drifted apart (largely because I felt their maturity levels and general intelligence were far below my own, I didnt feel Hyperactive behavior I could have a conversation with any of them where they could actually understand what I was trying to say to them). The only real reason I hung out with them was so Id have someone to play Xbox with. In tenth grade, as I was distancing myself from this group I met a girl. She was incredible. Pretty, dedicated, honest, and most importantly, welcoming. After months I finally managed the courage to ask her out. She said no, and while I was disappointed at the time, it was probably for the better. She asked me to start hanging out with her and some of her friends. Being the inspiring person she was, her friends quickly welcomed me to the group. After this, I quickly made friends as I was introduced to more people and became better at coming out of my shell. Today I have a network of friends who I care about more than anything, and I continue to make friends as I go. I even have had a couple of SOs. Things will get better. Youll find your place eventually. Become friends with people who respect you. If anything, try to become friends with one person. I guarantee that youll see your group of friends start to grow at an almost exponential rate.  If you couldnt land the Flatulence station, then try and find a super market. Theyre used to Drug abuse school students, so they dont mind training you. If you can drive and arent attending school, then youre already beating out the Drug abuse school kids in terms of cost/benefit.  How much time did you give the doctors that put you on meds? Usually psychiatrists will try different med combos with you and monitor you until theyre sure youre chemically stable, and then begin cognitive therapy with you later on. However, they should still be there for you to vent during every step of the way. If a doctor isnt offering that to you then you should really find a different shrink.  A quick addition: the worst case scenario by going with this is that you manage to make a few friends and youre able to go under the radar for the remainder of middle/Drug abuse school.  I have ADHD. The only jobs Ive hated have been the jobs that didnt let me create and be proud of what I do, as well as those that didnt respect me and the things I did. I worked at a camp as an IT/Video Editor/Audio Tech/Graphic Designer sort of thing for five summers. I got too work on cool projects Hyperactive behavior helping kids make short films, rebuilt the camp in Minecraft for kids to play around in, and even setup a radio station that broadcasted online and throughout the camp. For four of them, I had this awesome department head who appreciated the work I did, and I was able to do my work in creative ways because he trusted me to successfully solve problems and complete tasks on my own. During my fifth year, they swapped out the manager. This new manager didnt know the first thing about most of what he was hired to do. All the fun, challenging things I got to do before dried up because he stopped approving them, not realizing that these were all things kids really enjoyed. Plus, any of the challenging things I did accomplish were totally lost on him because he couldnt even comprehend the effort it took to get most of these things done. I did not return for a six year (there were other reasons, but this was a big one). Trust me, if you find a job that meets the requirements of Respect and Creativity, then youll find your job far more enjoyable. Ive started an internship working as an audio engineer, and youd be surprised how many people in the music industry, many of whom exhibit clear signs of disorders Hyperactive behavior ADHD, found jobs there because it was the only job that they didnt feel Hyperactive behavior they had to force themselves through.  Ive been told for years that \"things will get better for me,\" and that \"life has their ups and downs.\" Ive always considered that to be such shit advice, but it really does get better. Seven months ago I had one friend I actually liked, and even he seemed Hyperactive behavior he was moving on from me. Six months ago I made my second friend. She helped me make my third and fourth, and they taught me how to make that number grow. Today, I have plans with friends consistently each weekend, I manage a band, I no longer eat lunch alone, and I have a beautiful girlfriend who takes every opportunity to let me know she loves me. It does get better. You might have to put in some effort. Right now youre limping, but eventually youll pick up pace. Youll make that first new friend and youll start to walk. That friend will introduce you to her friends, and youll start to run. Before you know it, youre going to be surrounded by people who love and care for you, and youll never even notice that youve started sprinting.Just keep promising yourself another tomorrow. Good luck, man.  You can call 911 and have them act as your own valet, but if you think you can get yourself to the emergency room, then Id go with that. Someone more seriously in jeoprady might need that ambulance.  I hate people who can break up with someone over Mental Depression, Anxiety Mental Depression, etc. He chose to try with you, he has to accept the fact that helping you through those situations is his responsibility  Unless you meant to piss your dad off, I dont think even that was your fault. Friends sleeping with your exs is... Unfortunate. As I said, drop those assholes. You dont need them fucking with your life. With betrayal comes revelation, and revelations herald the chance to move on.Find a new group, one that is healthier for you than the one youre dealing with now.  If you tell us whats wrong, we can try to help you.  I do the same thing, but without the prompts. I show them to people I trust sometimes. They seem to Hyperactive behavior them. I think the reason writing stories helps is because it helps to think through problems in a way that doesnt involve much overthinking; once youve written something down, youre on to the next thought. Theres no time to think, contradict yourself, rethink, self-debate the new thought, rethink again, etc. You just think, write, and continue.  This isnt necessarily a solution, but Ive been screwing with the idea of a Phobia, Social network where people can vent openly, develop support groups through online chat, and seek professional help. If something Hyperactive behavior this did exist, would you be more open to speaking to others in that way? Or is opening yourself up in any way just a difficult concept?  /r/TheMixedNuts (a support group on Reddit) has actually just started a Steam group. I believe there are details in their side bar.  Dude, fingers down the throat, now. You cant take fucking dex with alcohol. What was the dosage on the dex? Was it in an extended release capsule? Either way, start gagging.  Id love to if its a \"when youre on, youre on\" sort of deal, but if its a shift-based sort of thing then Im not sure Ill be able to make it work.  Have you ever taken a walk through the woods? Maybe sat down by a stream and just watched? Perhaps you should try it. It sounds totally gay, but I think it may help. And perhaps you need to think objectively. Did you do anything to bring on your friends actions? I Irritable Mood really think, and be honest with yourself about this. If you didnt, then perhaps they werent the kind of friends you want to have. Find a different group. It may not feel Hyperactive behavior it, but there has to be a group of people out there who will accept you.  Fun fact: Most people who commit Suicide actually leave a note. Its hypothesized that writing helps people take stock, and ultimately helps most people realize the things they have to live for. Should you try to commit  again, make sure to write another note. The five minutes it takes could save your life.  Junior here, as well. Like I said, dont let yourself drop your shit. Lucky for us, weve only got two more years of the wonderful prisons they send us to.Try to find another group of friends. If you go to clubs, I can guarantee youll make friends. Even if you sit there alone the first few times, youll eventually be able to join the conversation. Eventually you might end up with some new friends who are far more decent than the ones you have.  Going into my senior year. I feel Hyperactive behavior I can offer you some advice here, having just gone through it. Drop a couple of the APs and accelerated classes. Aside from having an Mental disorders workload, you wont have any time for extra curriculars or Phobia, Social interaction. Extra-curriculars can be even more important than an AP class to some colleges. Colleges want to see you work hard for sure, but theres a difference between working hard and working to death. Find a way to create a workload that will cause you put in effort, but not so much that youre choking. Lets talk about \"rigorous workload\" for a moment. \"Rigorous workload\", which is a phrase Im sure guidance counselors have shoved down your god damn throat the last few months (and theyre going to keep doing it for most of the next year), means not breezing through your classes. It means that you should take classes where you can still consistently pull As and Bs if you put in a somewhat above average effort. In my last three years of Drug abuse school Ive watched kids alienate themselves because they have no time for others, and basically turn themselves into drones who havent matured since middle school because theyve spent so much time studying the same things over and over. Bottomline, dont get yourself killed because you worked too hard. Your junior year is a big year not only in that colleges will watch, but in that youre going to develop socially by an absolute *fuckton*. This is the year where you take a very large step towards becoming a Phobia, Social adult, and thats way more valuable than whatever extra crap youll learn in AP Social Studies or English (which are least recognized and the most work). My recommendation? Drop two APs, preferably English unless you have a passion for it. Take that science course, as well as the college course. Theres no shame in prioritizing where you focus yourself. Im headed for NYU with not a single AP class, just a lot of electives that I really worked hard at, and extra curriculars that show both leadership and a passion for my chosen field.  Fuck that bitch. You dont need her. You have any hobbies? Whats something that you Hyperactive behavior doing? Seriously dude: hobbies &gt; girlfriends.  Dont fall behind on your work. As someone who regularly misses school from Mental Depression, I can tell you that it just makes school harder getting back. Youre seventeen. Junior, or senior?  If shes your best friend, then Im sure shell listen. I find that sometimes I automatically assume the worst to come from someone, when really Ive probably just misread the situation. You may be somewhat doing this here. Obviously Im not in your situation, so thats something youll need to assess yourself, but Im certain that you should at least try doing something, as doing nothing is rarely the solution.  If you enjoyed talking to the girl but dont Hyperactive behavior therapists, you should consider finding a support group. I know theres a stigma to them, but having someone to talk to does help.And yeah, most of the hospital rooms are kind of scary. Sometimes rooms are nice, but when I had been hospitalized (twice) they were these Depersonalization white rooms, scuff marks on the wall, a TV that couldnt be turned on from inside the room because it was placed behind a plastic window. The first time I went there was a man who kept scratching into scarred and bloodied ankles. Whenever I descirbe this to people they think Im lying because it was such a stereotypical horror movie environment. If youre staying there for an extended period then you get fancy rooms, but when youre being evaluated for admittance they put you in the sketchiest rooms ever. Anyway, Im glad you didnt go through with it. Dex is not something you wanna fuck with. You might notice some residual effects over the next few days, especially in relation to your heart/chest. You should be alright, but Id make sure someone around you knows. If you end up having a heart attack, that bit of info could be the deciding factor in whether or not the paramedics/doctors can save you.  Since it would seem that the issue is resolved for the moment, I feel that it might be beneficial to give some advice that might help reduce your chances of being in this situation again: Wait to be in another relationship until you can be happy by yourself. This is common advice among /r/sex and /r/relationshipadvice. If your SO is what you feel to be the major source of your happiness, and you dont feel happy without a SO, then it makes losing them much, much harder. Its Hyperactive behavior trying to stay Wakefulness on coffee. You can definitely try to stave off drowsiness, but eventually youll fall Somnolence and Drug withdrawal syndrome much harder than you wouldve if you just followed a regular Hypersomnia pattern to begin with. You need to be comfortable with yourself before you can be comfortable with someone else.  Did you try going to the real police? The statute of limitations for sexual crimes, at least in New York, can range from five years to no limitation. Pressing charges might help get you that closure, or at least some cash to pay for therapy.  Is there some kind of post that honors those weve lost? I think this guy needs to be added to the list, if there is one. I think its sobering. Helps remind us why we do what we do. If we dont markup our losses someone based on moral reasoning, I get that and apologize. It just feels Hyperactive behavior posts should be together somehow, as some kind of acknowledgement for those who havent been able to hold on in the battle against their ailments. A \"Memorial to the Fallen Soldiers\", if you will.  We do it to people who are offering advice that goes against the subreddit rules, or people who tell us not to try.  Cool. Thanks for the input. When I say professional help, I meant contact information and some kind of review system or a way of recommending therapists that certain people may get along with (it seems to be different for everyone).  Tell people. If only two people celebrate, then thats two more people than wouldve celebrated it before.  Some charity work is a great way to smudge out that misedemeanor charge. The \"reformed criminal\" story is a powerful one, and could even make you stand out more if you include your charity work in an application. As for misdemeanor, do you mind if I ask what you were charged with and where? Many misdemeanors, depending on their severity, are ignored by more forgiving employers. That time you were caught with a dub of weed at 17 probably doesnt Irritable Mood much to employers a few years later.  As far as girls accepting your past, I have pulled some seriously fucked up shit in the past. My current girlfriend has been okay with all of it, or at least the worst of it. Everyone has done shit that they will never be proud of our be able to forget, and the Drug abuse-and-mighty people who wont are people you dont want to be around. Also, you have to understand that you cant control the things you find attractive or sexually exciting. You shouldnt feel guilty for experimenting, especially as a horny-as-fuck teenager. Also, youre a really good person for not doing anything with that 16 year old. A really, *really* good person. You have no idea the kind of damage that could have done, to your life and hers. Be proud of yourself for showing the restraint. Keep in mind that you have an entire life ahead of you to cancel out all of the bad. If you end things now, then youll be leaving with a rather poor legacy that few will remember. If you spend the rest of your life trying to atone, which I think its something you want to do, then start atoning. Find a way to make a difference. Join the Peace Corps. Start working with a charity. Find some way to help fix the world. You want to atone then do it. That said, if you want to atone, you have to admit that some of the things youve done were your fault. They dont make you bad, but they were *your* decision. Your mom didnt make you do these things. Your computer didnt make you do these things. It was you. Now its *your* job to make up for them.  Fun fact: flossing is actually considered more important. Your tongue naturally will rub away plaque (although not as well as a toothbrush), but it cant get between your teeth.  Obamacare made me switch insurance, and my local pharmacy doesnt support our new insurance. I had to switch to CVS and I totally feel your pain. CVS sucks.  You shouldnt rush putting trust into them. Let trust come as it wants to. Just be sure that you arent inhibiting your ability to trust by pushing yourself away once you start getting close to someone. Allow trust to exist, but do not force it.Are these people associated with the people you used to be friends with? Or are these people rather separate?  35mg shouldnt do too much damage if youre relatively healthy. I take 50mg a day, so youre covered on that route. Heart palpitations are a normal side effect for people who arent put onto it slowly. Im actually kind surprised your CVS carried dex at all. Its usually a prescription thing.  Alright, my bad. Ill keep it in mind from now on.  Unfortunately, requesting someone to contact you outside of the subreddit is against the subreddit guidelines. However, I am more than glad to help you with your issue here in the comment thread. First is the matter of your girlfriend. Are the both of you still together? If she ignores you when you drink, is it because she thinks you have a drinking problem? Either way, it sounds Hyperactive behavior you can do better. Your significant other is not supposed to turn their back on you when youre facing difficulty. Theyre supposed to be there to help you through it, especially if they perceive it as a problem when you dont. This aspect of your issue may be better dealt with on /r/sex or /r/relationshipadvice, where such issues are common. Second is your family history of Suicide. If this is something that recurs through your family, you may want to try reaching out to any family members who either have Mental Depression and have not tried to kill themselves (note that these people can not help you if there solution was mask their Mental Depression via addictive substances), or to any family members who have attempted Suicide and have since recovered. These people may be able to best help you with what youre dealing with.Lastly, you wanted someone to talk to. While /r/suicidewatch is a great place to do just that, it may be more beneficial to see a therapist or psychologist. Given that your Mental Depression may be genetic, it may also be beneficial to consider a psychiatrist. You especially should consider this if you can not find a suitable family member to talk to. You wanna talk to us about what else is bothering you? This girl cant have been all that great of things just sort of stopped on their own.  It may be worth explaining in your resume. \"To atone for my past mistakes, Ive been visiting AA and have been doing charity work for [cause]. I feel Hyperactive behavior Ive done harm to the world, and its my goal to make up for my past actions.\" or you know, something along those lines. You dont necessarily have to believe it, but it makes it more powerful if you have a passion to do something Hyperactive behavior that. You started off saying that you felt Hyperactive behavior youve been dropped to rock bottom. Perhaps on your journey back from rock bottom, you should do it as a sort of atonement. It might give you the sense of purpose that you need to keep going.  Whats your dosage? I only take 10mg tabs, and I only get very vivid dreams occasionally. I imagine youre taking a lot more than I am. Edit: Just realized that it might be a bit rude to ask about your dosage.  Its not so much about finding perspective, but instead about finding excitement. Its about looking forward to being with the people who love you. Life is nothing if you cant find excitement. Make plans. Ensure that tomorrow will be a good day. It makes getting to tomorrow much easier.  Yeah, those subreddits are seriously fucked up. Ignore them. Theyre made by shallow people, for shallow people. They are people whose standards are set ridiculously, unrealistically Drug abuse; standards that they themselves likely can not live up to. Ignore them. Whatever flaws they pointed out are things that no normal and adjusted individual would ever notice.  Are you in AA? If you are, you can have your sponsor as a contact. I believe its actually encouraged, but I suppose it depends on your sponsor.  Attacking is kind of messed up. I know that you said that changing bands wasnt an option, but you should consider it. Leaving on your own terms will make you much happier than leaving on theirs. \"Do not post generic uplifting or anti-Suicide messages.\" It says not to do what youre advocating right there in the sidebar.Pointless positive comments dont help. In fact, theyre exactly the sort of thing that people want to avoid in this subreddit. They want people to hear their issues, because most people dont. They hear \"Suicide\" and the advice they given response is \"Dont be doing that,\" rather than \"Talk to me about it.\" This community offers people who want to talk about whats bothering them. Providing the generic \"it gets better\" response doesnt help when it feels Hyperactive behavior everything in your life is falling apart.  Ive been the manager of two bands, and as someone with depression, I feel that Im very careful about trying to let someone down firmly. Its important to realize that a band, or at least a band that plans on going somewhere, is a business. Each member is an employee, and they have to maintain their job performance to maintain their job. That said, a band is also a team. Every member has to be working to help the other. You said that you understand that youre responsible for your performance (which is great, because not fingerpointing shows a lot of maturity). Did you at any point try to tell them that you need their help to pull through?  I can assure you, getting out isnt the answer. Telling me whats bothering you; I guarantee that we can find a different solution if we work together.  Or we can be civil and discuss it, rather than curse each other out Hyperactive behavior thug kids on a playground. \n",

      "- I have a longing to kill myself  or  what s the point I m home for a semester dealing with my meds and I don t have a job  just to give you some context into my monotonous existence I have a great mother and father who love me dearly  and I have some friends coming to town in about a week or so and another good friend visiting shortly after that  so I do have something here to look forward to  But they ll be gone eventually I have plenty of people who care about me  but I just see no point to existence  Currently  I m stuck in the nest with my folks  My extremely loving folks are wonderful and they tell me daily that I have so much to live for But I still want to die  I get to see my shrink this Thursday  and I still want to die  I guess my main problem is that I m so bored right now that I want to kill myself  But even when next semester rolls around  I don t really see the point in anything either  I want to be a rock star physicist  but I know at most I ll just be a mediocre researcher  I have big dreams  but I know they won t get me anywhere because I lack the discipline and willpower to carry through on any of my ambitions I used to use video games and drugs to escape from reality  But recently  I haven t found enjoyment from video games  This will sound silly  but I really wish I could take some drug that d make me hopelessly addicted to a video game  And I ve been staying off the drugs since I had a psychotic experience which culminated in me dropping out of school last semester I m   and I ve never kissed a girl  I suppose I could use a girlfriend  but I d be more of a parasite on the relationship than anything  I ve only had one girl in my life that came close to being my girlfriend  The most we did was hold hands and hug and watch a movie  Sometimes I cry about being a virgin at my age when all my friends have had various escapades with women I m not entirely sure why I m writing this  I guess it is just so I can get some internet hugs  feedback  and get some things off my chest while I wait to see my doc I guess there are some things I want to do in my life  like get a graduate degree in physics and have a family  but what is the point  These things will just make little chemicals like serotonin and dopamine happy in my meager head  Is that enough to live for  Eventually I ll grow out of my parent s nest and will have to make my own somewhere with someone I don t believe in God but I feel like I need God to exist  I would then have a purpose in fulfilling God s will  Wouldn t it be great if God existed and all we had to do was follow his word and go to heaven  But there s too much evil in the world  and free will is an illusion  We re prisoners to our body chemistry  biochemical processes  and genetics  I don t see why  for example  God would create a murderer and send his own creation to hell I feel like one of my only contributions to mankind has been my  completely crappy poetry http rw blogspot com  I ve written so much  but it ll never be as beautiful as anything Robert Frost  Emily Dickinson  or W B  Yeats has written  Nor will it be as beautiful as anything Chopin or Mussorgsky has composed If I had money  all I d do is spend it on alcohol  I feel like that s one of the few things I have left in which to waste my time with  If I wasn t living in my parents house currently  I d probably be an alcoholic to escape from the world  There s so much the world has to offer  but it just doesn t seem to interest me anymore I suppose I m looking forward to some video games like Diablo   and Skyrim  but those are just there to further help me escape from reality  which alcohol and pot have helped me do in the past  I just want to escape  I d read more  but I don t have any good books or know of any to read  I ve been trying to work through The Lord of the Rings  but I ve read them previously and seen the movies  so it s boring to re read them Still  I suppose the ultimate escape from reality is suicide  I don t imagine I can kill myself  I won t  But I have this yearning to  I know I ll be alive a long time  and experience a lot  and consume even more as far as games  books  and movies go  But I still ask myself  what s the point  We spend our time on these things  and then we die and are forgotten  unless you become famous  And I highly doubt I will become famous  All I will have are these indelible marks on the internet under my moniker instago and again  my mediocre poetry for my friends and family to remember me by  I guess it d be awesome to one day do something great and have a wikipedia page on me  but that s far fetched I don t know  friends  I guess I m just another nihilist and hedonist who thinks about suicide every now and again  I have plenty to live for  but I feel like I ll just fall back into drugs and alcohol when I m back in school because video games just aren t doing it for me anymore I realize I am blessed to have what I do have  There are many posters here that have it much worse than I do  And my heart goes out to them We re just  specks http rw blogspot com speck html  on a big speck revolving around a larger speck  and nothing in our lives really does matter except to other specks  In the end  we die and there s nothing left except a page on wikipedia if you re especially lucky I feel like I m trapped inside this body  I don t know if I believe in souls  but after watching some paranormal reality TV like TAPS and Ghost Adventures  I wonder if there really are spirits and apparitions  I suppose that s cool  And maybe some of the UFOs that have visited us have actually been extraterrestrial intelligences  Also cool  But  I ve covered this before  there is no point  We just go on consuming media to pass the time  work so we can consume more  and die  There really is no point unless you find yourself needing something like I have  mainly  a new nest since I ll grow out of my parents  But I m fat and not so good looking  and shallow  so the chances of me finding a beautiful cutie to spend the rest of my life with is very slim I guess I ll stop here and summarize  I have plenty of support  I have some things I want to do and things I m looking forward to  but I still find myself wanting to cease to exist  and I still find myself asking  what s the point\n",
      "- Give me a reason to stay aliveEveryone says it ll get better but it won t  If anything it s getting worse  I m having daily suicide thoughts and the only thing stopping me from doing it are my parents and best friends  I think I m too cowardly to actually kill myself  but I m terrified that I m going to spend the rest of my life just  existing\n",
      "- It s not worth it  None of it  Not a single drop  Ounce  Nothing I eat only so my stomach stops hurting  I sleep so I don t lose the rest of my sanity  I breathe because it s involuntary  I function only to do the bear minimum  Why  I am not enjoying life  I am not doing anything productive or that adds value or meaning to this world  I feel sick all the time  What is the point to even face another day in which I ll feel these things all over  What s the point of going on when I don t feel human  When I am numb  What s the point\n",
      "- I can t take this anymoreI ve been thinking for months about how I FEEL alone  I realized tonight that its not just a feeling  I AM alone  The only way to stop this hurting is to end it\n",
      "- When does it get better Everyone says it will get better  but it doesn t  I ve been bullied and alone for years  I have a best friend who is moving and therefore  abandoning me  Great  I wish people would stop caring  My mom  my friend  and another girl  That fact they care or act like they do is the only thing stopping me  I honestly don t see any point in my life  Nothing will change  I m afraid to die  but the idea of living is miserable\n",
      "- People say life is like climbing a staircase to achieve goals but for me it feels like im just tumbling down the stairs I think I might OD tomorrow  I know I have a small chance of dying but maybe for once I ll be lucky in life  I cant even handle therapy  every nice thing people say about me feels like a lie  I m so fucking tired of this life  How much of a masochist do you have to be to enjoy living I ve become everything I thought I wouldnt be  a failure  terrible at school  depressed  and more  I hope people move on fast  maybe theyll be happy I m dead so Im not such a burden\n",
      "- Difficulty coping with being a physically non desirable man Sort of bought into the narrative that looks weren t all that important for a man  Pretty ridiculous looking back how I never experienced intimacy with a girl before the age of    and that was with a very low self esteem girl and ended badly    Always thought my personality was to blame  Sort of kept the wheel turning like an idiot  have a masters degree in physics  did enjoy my time in physics though  went into medicine after that which in hindsight was a stupid decision but I thought it was something I wanted to do at the time  Now a radiologist in training  I m in a comfy space financially  have a vivid social life  not a lot of close friends though  I do organise sport events  cycling  and other stuff and try building my leadership qualities  I feel bit of satisfaction from time to time  but it s very few and far in between  I m also getting a bit more female attention now even though I ve never been intimate with a second girl  While a intimate relationship is what I desire  ultimately a loving partner I can care and provide for and be cared for by  I don t feel very good about this  I have almost  years of experience that women are not attracted to me so I can only assume these people want to use me  I ve experienced this many times now  only after finding out about my accomplishments  what I work and where I live they warm up to me  I cannot trust them  I know this doesn t sound too terrible but I don t know how to cope with the fact that I jumped through all those hoops to have a shot at getting laid just a space holder it s not about sex  with someone who ll use and discard me  while better looking people can just experience  true love    I feel like it s a no win situation and I feel incredibly inferior  The only thing keeping me alive right now are my parents for I don t want to hurt the only people who truly love me and a few friends\n",
      "- Suicidal againA few months ago I couldn t handle the thought of life and the place I got diagnosed worked hard and quick to get me on some medicine  Now I have been on medicine for a few months  both for depression and excessive thought  yet my suicidal thought are coming back  My anxiety is getting worse and I have no energy anymore  Like hell I can barely even set up my computer so I can work on commission draw  Or set up my PS  so I can game and relax  I don t have that energy  Not even to take a bath or clean my room  I feel disgusting but tbh I don t know what I can do  all I really want is to just kill myself\n",
      "- That s it I m taking the pillsI am tired of feeling this way  I am tired of being a worthless piece of shit  I would be better off dead I should of done this a long time ago  I dropped out of highschool I don t have a job and I am going to be   soon  My family never understood the bullying  my depression or how there actions effected me  My family always has put me down and made me feel like shit but they are right I am a piece of shit  Bye everyone I can t do this anymore\n",

      "- am i selfish for wanting to live so i have a pretty good life tbf but i ama massive dickhead i mean reeeeaaaaal dick to those who are close to me and i dont fully appreciate how kind people are to me i always think that itd be a whole lot better for everyone if i didnt exist sapping all their love and giving nothing back or for future friends lovers children ect who will have to deal with me i have been thinking that i could just get rid of myself and make it alot easier for possibly dozens of people but i dont want to die i love life theres so much that i love doing but this just makes me feel even more selfish becausei amonly staying here because i have such a good time personally i dont know what responses i want if any i just needed to let someone know this becausei amusually quite a happy person and i doubt anyone would ever think that id ever even considered suicide thankyou for reading anywayedit just ignore this i dont really think i plan on killing myself and there are people on here who reeeaaally do need help i just wanted a bit if an outleti am sorry\n",
      "- i don t know why i am even trying everybody hates me \n",
      "- dear mom i m sorry i couldn t make you any prouder of me i m sorry i didn t turn out the way you wanted me to be i m sorry i m a disappointment to you \n",
      "- still not happy so i got a part time job but is actually a full time job back doing hair while i m in school i wasam happy to be back working and thought it would be good for me while i m in school while i m making great tips and decent money in still not happy and think about suicide just as much if not more i feel like nothing in life is going to make me feel like i m doing something productive with my time i feel like i want to end it before the semester is up but i know i won t so i ll just keep staying suicidal and do nothing about it \n",
      "- my family hates me the title speaks for itself my sister hit me multiple for actually being happy today apparently i was too loud when i was laughing my parents they always call me names idiot stupid bitchedit my mother just said go back to your room you lazy fuck youll just be a dumb bitch to everyone else all because i said a box was to heavy \n",
      "- they re not just upset with me they re scared of me two of them are scared of how d i d react to what they would say and one of them was hesitant on telling the counselorand this other girl she s afraid that i m some sort of stalker or molester she was thinking about being friends again but i kept messaging her asking to be friends again when she didn t want to talkit was hard accepting that they may not want to be friends again but i thought they realised that i had changed but this i just don t know what to do\n",
      "- is it normal to be envious of someone who just committed suicide i dont thinki amyour typical depressed person or maybe i am and just dont realize it ive been very depressed since i was about 16i amnow 25 i dont have the support system i wish i did and i dont have the money for a therapist i drink smoke weed and take prescription pills to copei dont buy these things my boyfriend does and i just take them becausei amthe worst person on the planet so i guess i will start with the reasons i thinki am so depressed when i was 16 i had what i thought was the perfect life with the perfect parents until the day my dad left my mom it was totally unwarranted i even remember me and my sisters laughing at him because we thought it was a joke not a joke fast forward to now i found out he had been cheating on my mom for 6 years my mom knew nothing my parents friends decided to leave her in the dark till after the divorce was final being sixteen and going through that was hell for me i remember trying to cut myself but i was too scared to cut too deep all i ended up with were little cat scratches on my wrist real edgy anyways so ive also been in love with someone for eh 9 years the problem being this person lives in a different country he had no intention of moving to the statescant say i blame him and to be honest if i were to move there i dont think he would want a relationship with me even though we talk frequently he tells me loves me from time to time but thats easy to say when you know youll never actually have to deal with the consequences of telling someone that so just about every yeartwo years i skip from relationship to relationship i think so i dont get attached i dk but its really hard on me mentally and its even harder because i dont truly understand why i do itokay so fast forward to last december i found out i was pregnant it was a weird feeling i was so overjoyed i think because i thought it would give me purpose i had just started a new job and didnt want to tell them immediately so i hid it from them it was hard to schedule the necessary appointments that way though one morning i woke up at 3am with horrible cramps i didnt fall back asleep i was getting up and around for work at 6 and i was spotting so i called into work i told them i thought it was an ovarian cyst when i got to the hospital everyone was really nicei think they already knew what was going on fast forward to getting an ultra sound and sitting there waiting 5 hours i found out that the fetus inside me was dead who knows how long i had been carrying that thing inside of me dead they gave me my options and i told them i would think about them make a few calls to my insurance provider and let them know tomorrow they sent me on my way at 6pm that night i had a miscarriage in my bed it was the most painful thing i have ever experienced nowi ampretty traumatized i mentally cant have sex anymore and its been putting a huge strain on my relationshipso i bought a gun my boyfriend thinks its because i want to practice shooting the real reason i bought it was because i figured that would be the easiest way for me to kill myself the problem isi am not afraid of death i could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now the other problem is that i am an empath and i know killing myself would hurt a lot of people its not their fault they dont understand how much paini am in ive tried to explain but they just tell me in sad and it will pass or maybe i should get some help well its really fucking difficult to get help wheni ambarely paying my car payment car insurance phone bill and rent plus gas for the hour to and from work ride i have mf so i guess i should explain how my title is involved a few days ago i found out someone i graduated high school with committed suicide my family has known his family forever but we werent ever really friends i found myself crying all day long over this person i was never friends with i realized i was crying because i was envious i wanted the courage he had to go through with it i really dont want to be here anymore but i dont know how to turn my conscience off to go though with iti dont know what to do anymore all i think about is killing myself i want it so bad i dont know if i will ever have the balls to do it or not but thanks for reading anyways and if anyone has any advice or anything to share id love to hear it\n",
      "- i messed up i went to college too soon idk about what classes to go to about diplomas or majors about how to do anything i think i should have done more research before i went to make sure i knew what i was doing before i went but my mom wanted me to go as soon as i graduated hs either tha or get a job i tried to get a job before but it causes me so my anxiety that i was scratching my arms till they bled and scarred so i thought college would just be like school but it wasnt i feel like i will be able to pay off my loans and i wont be able to get a job either and i am so stressed i feel like i ruined my life i have no job experience or anything to even put on resume except for like some volunteer work i did in hs god this is so hard i dont know to be an adult and it seems like everyone else knows what theyre doing i feel so useless and moneys tight rn and i need to be making money but finding a job is so difficulti am so lazy too i just sit around doing nothing because i dont got a job and i got nobody to talk to but family i want to die so badly\n",

      "- even when things are going relatively well i would rather just not livei am20 years old and a couple courses away from a community college diploma in accounting which can be transferred to give me half of the credits for a bachelorsi was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was about 13 but i never went on medicationi have had good times and bad times over the past few years it seems that recently the bad times have been getting more frequentsome courses in school give me no problem at all i aced things like financial accounting but if i have to write anything i will probably failfrom the time i was 9 i remember struggling to write stories in class now days tell me to write a memo essay or even something short and i just cant do it i have tried dictating it but that doesnt help i feel i just dont have the ideas in my head to put on paper even when i had to write physics lab reports i found it impossibledue to this i dont think i will ever be able to finish university and i cant handle working somewhere like a grocery store for my whole lifei amfrom canada but this yeari amspending a year abroad in belgium as an au pair i met my girlfriend in a community jazz band while she was taking a gap year in canada and i followed her back to belgium about a month ago she is so amazing and probably the one thing keeping me from falling into a deep depression and seriously considering suicide right nowi have one day a week totally free and i basically slept the whole day i should be exploring belgium 0 or at least go for a walk down the street i talked to my girlfriend and she has been supportive and is trying to help me get out of the house but i find it impossible some days are okay yesterday i went to audition for a choir and it went fairly well she is a very motivated person and i amscared that me doing nothing could pull us aparti also start things with a great deal of motivation but it typically fades quickly and i want to quit this happens with things like school sports work and any other type of activity really it happens even if it is something i really like i just find it hard to drag myself to iti need to figure out how to finish school i need to figure out how to stay motivated be able to tolerate my job and stop being such a negative person all the timeright nowi am really freaked out because i dont know how i can get through all of this i dont know what i will do with my life i have this year to figure things out then i have to go back to canada we did a few months already but a long distance relationship will be its own challenge and face reality i can stay with my mom as long as i am going to school i am thinking maybe i should push through the 3 courses and get my diploma as a checkpoint i was just going to go to university and go straight for my bachelors as i still get the transfer credits but i dont have a clue what i should do after that i think i should probably talk to a professional again i most likely shouldnt wait untili amback in canada but doing it here in belgium is intimidatingthanks\n",
