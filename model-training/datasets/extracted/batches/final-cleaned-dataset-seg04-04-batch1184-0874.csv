221152,"I usually use this sub as a source of venting, but never have I once actually thought I would commit suicide in the near future. I always imagined it would happen in my 20s, but as of lately I’m thinking it could happen in a few years. Everyday death is getting less and less scary to me. Death was my #1 fear for the longest time but now it doesn’t scare me that much. I’m afraid as my emotions continue to grow and the more sleep deprived I am I’ll finally do it one day. And then I’ll be happy. Nobody is giving me the one thing that could save me, and that one thing is love. I give love but I never receive. Just to feel someone close to me and have them love me would be enough reason to live but it won’t happen. Not once in a million years.",1,"As of lately, everyday death is getting less and less scary to me. Death was my #1 fear for the longest time, but now it doesn't scare me that much.

221153,"It's actually not a complete list but like one thing that I hate more than just about anything. People who act like they can relate. Unless your entire life is consumed with wanting to die you can't relate. I'm new to this sub and honestly don't even know how I found it. I just kinda stumbled upon it. After a couple of days of reading posts I noticed a lot of people telling people, hang in there, it will get better, someone loves you, blah, blah, blah. 

I totally appreciate that there are people out there who actually do care but sometimes it doesn't get better and sometimes nobody out there loves you. There is not one single person on this planet that gives a fuck about me. Including my family. Telling me that there is is just a little bit insulting. So on behalf of those on here who really hate themselves please don't say you know how we feel unless you are having the same struggles. If you want to help just offer to be open and available to talk and more importantly listen without being judgmental. Sometimes it's just nice to be able to unload your burdens without being judged or having someone tell you what to do.",1,People who act like they can relate to someone's struggles is insulting to those who hate themselves.

221155,"I know my self esteem is bad but I didn’t know it was that bad. Realizing now that my self esteem leads to why I wish I was dead. I think my existence is the biggest burden that anyone could ever face. That I’m so ugly, just by looking at me, people wish they were dead too. Hearing my voice puts a stain on their day and ruins it. I’m scared to leave the house in case anyone sees me. I wish I could personally apologize to every person who’s met me or even laid eyes on me, but that would involve interacting with them, and I would never wish that experience on anybody. I believe that I will never be deserving of love, respect, honesty, or even anyone’s time because I’m me. My personality is horrible, my face looks horrible, my body is horrible. It makes me want to die. I feel like the world would be heaven on earth if I just wasn’t on it anymore. I wasn’t always like this. This blew up in the past 2 years. The only man I’ve ever loved, and loved more than I thought anyone could ever experience, lied to me and cheated. I already had low self esteem before hand, but not this bad. She ended up being abusive towards him, and he still loved her more than he loved me. So much so that when she demanded that he completely cut off contact with me (despite us having a child together), he agreed. Every now and then he would secretly check in and I would update him on our child. But despite beating him he would still brag about her to me like it didn’t her, how she was “the pretty girl” wherever they went, how she was out of his league, how he fell in love with her so quickly. I will never be her. I will never be loved, or respected, or cared about. I don’t feel like there’s any reason for me to be on this earth anymore. I will never have a fulfilling life, and if someone’s abusive girlfriend is better than me (even when I’ve never abused anyone), I must really be the worst person to ever be on this earth. I don’t think I deserve to live anymore.",1,"In the past 2 years, the man she loved lied to her and cheated on her. She had a child together with him, but she was abusive towards him.

221169,"Hello, I'm just simply asking for advice on here if that is okay.
I have a lover who I very much love and hold close dearly, I love them very much.
I won't share too much info about my partner, but they went through a lifetime of hardships and putting themselves in self-destructive situations like self-harm and starvation. They'd rather have no body care for them, but rathermore have that go towards others. 
I've had my fair share of depression and being suicidal, so I know how that is and managed to help them through tough times.
But I'm still worried, they're very self-destructive and self-degrading and they struggle with opening up about their problems, thoughts, and feelings. And then there is me, a perfectly happy, and energetic person. 
To make matters worse, my lover is long-distance, they live states away from me. So what I can really do is limited, so what can I do? I'm doing my best and doing all the right things, like comfort, treating them humanely, and giving them their own time and space to speak about it. Yet, I'm still worried.

221187,"I’m so sick of living every day life. I’m going to be 30 in a couple months and I haven’t done anything with my life. I got rid of all my ‘’friends’’ like 8 years ago because they were toxic and were only my friends so they could use me; those are the only friends I could ever make, same with girlfriends, which I also haven’t had one of in 8 years, but that stuff isn’t important. I hang out with my Mom every night and it’s been keeping me alive since 8 years ago. Without her, I would end it. The rest of my family is around but they don’t like the real me, and I know they all consider me a huge burden/loser. I’m in constant physical pain from several conditions because I never took care of myself growing up. I don’t want to make any changes to better my health, I don’t want to go to a doctor, I don’t care about any of that bullshit. I just wish I could die in my sleep one night. Leave the world peacefully. The pain has kept me from enjoying life’s basic things. And as far as a girlfriend, let’s just say I am the least well endowed person on the entire planet, so we all know how that goes. And besides I’m too messed up and ugly and fat for anyone to like anyways. I just want the pain to end, the emotional pain, and the physical pain. I’m sick of living this way. It’ll only get worse. Oh well. Guess another night of me going to sleep depressed with some music...",1,I'm 30 in a few months and I haven't done anything with my life. I got rid of all my toxic friends 8 years ago.

221194,"I wasn't thinking about suicide for a fucking month. But everything's changed again, my parents are fighting constantly and my report card came back with the lowest grades I've ever fucking gotten. And here I am, wishing we had enough pills to actually do *something* for once in my pathetic fucking life. 

Everyone I know would be better off without me. My parents wouldn't try and stick together for me, despite them being miserable, my teachers wouldn't have to waste time on me and my friends wouldn't have to try and stay in contact with me. They'd be so much happier.

221196,I’m in a spot where I bounce between contemplating suicide and believing in myself that I can grow and move past my struggles. But today has just been so draining and even though I met with my new therapist and was hopefully now I just feel like nobody understands or cares what I’m going through.

221200,"Quick summary! I am only 21 y.o. but I have a lot going on! Intergenerational trauma on my mother's side of the family. Pure evil on the important (to my existence) father's side of the family - to the point where my father tried to kill my mother and me and he may have killed my dog. My mother is chronically ill. I have been more than half my life in poverty. The house she and I live in belongs legally to my father and only to him. I've studied a university degree that can only worsen my mental health. My life is an unfunny joke, I have self-hate, depression, cPTSD, chronic sleep insomnia, overall horrible health, terrible coping mechanisms, etc. I miss my dog so much. And so much stuff that is left out of the summary.


I have no agency in my life and today a close friend who knows this shamed me/ tried to persuade me not to kill myself. I mean??? I'm only human!!? There's people who can't handle one relatively minor thing such as being a virgin and I am supposed to carry all these baggage all my life??
