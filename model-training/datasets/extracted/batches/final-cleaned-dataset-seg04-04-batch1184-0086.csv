181760,Alcoholic depressed uncle on the verge  advice Throwaway  I don t know if this is the right subreddit so feel free to point me elsewhere My uncle has been an alcoholic pretty much all his life  At this point though  he can t eat or even really interact with people without picking a fight and getting his ass beat  He sleeps in his car most nights not because he has no choice  but because he just doesn t bother to go to a friend s or just get a hotel  Hasn t had a job in maybe a year  been in and out of rehab but always checks himself out and goes back to drinking  Family has all tried to take him in but he eventually overstays his welcome by drinking and picking fights with neighbors  yelling at all hours and generally being a giant asshole After his dad died   years ago he s talked often about suicide and attempted once but was talked down by neighbors cops I just heard that he s saying goodbye to his relatives and passed a message along to me  I ve slowly realized that he was an all around shitty guy and was always mean to everyone  including me although maybe less so because I was a kid at the time  That makes me want to ignore the whole situation because I ve never really known him well and I don t think he knows me really either  In fact  I d say he s been nothing but a bad influence  although funny at times  In a dark  assholish way I guess I m asking for advice   I feel like I should do something  I can t give him purpose in life or stop him from drinking or anything  but I also find it hard to just sit around waiting for him to kill himself or die of liver failure I know it s not really my responsibility nor my decision  but  I guess I just want to hear what people here have to say  If there s anything that could be done or said to help  whatever that even means Anyways  thanks for reading,1,Uncle has been an alcoholic and depressed all his life.
