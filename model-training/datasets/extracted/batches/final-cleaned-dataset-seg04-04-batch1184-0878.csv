Well, almost. Failed not my final attempt of graduation work pre-defence. Next attempt is only in september. But...

I hear parents arguing. They're really angry. I'm afraid that they will come to my room now and start shouting at me.

I will have to live with these people for two more months. They said that they'll force me to study everyday and that I will not be allowed to go outside.

I want to run away somewhere.

I'm so ashamed of everything I done.

I wish I was either drunk or dead.

It's raining heavily outside.

I wish I was able to kill myself",1,It's raining heavily outside. My parents are arguing and I'm afraid they will come to my room now and start shouting at me.

I told my family that I'm really depressed. That I wanted to kill myself.  


It dind't mean shit to them.  


It went from conversation to a full blown argument, where I pointed out all the shitty things they ever done. They don't care if I die. They think I said that only to make them feel guilty, to villify them...

221355,"My mother is the sweetest person ever, i love her so much, more than anything else. Her health is really bad and going downhill everyday and the day she dies i don't think i'll be able to live for myself. I've been using drugs for a long time to cope and for some sort of happiness and fulfilment, but now i've been sober because my parents found out after i had an extremely bad acid trip. Now i have nothing to even cope with anymore. Everyday living is such a pain and the only reason that i haven't ended everything is because of her, she said she wants to see me happy before she dies and i don't think i can do that. 

I don't have enough willpower to even try and help myself anymore, my emotions are so unstable and I've been on so many medications and seen so many therapists and nothing helps. I've gone through so many lows and suicide attempts and i thought i would've hit rock bottom by now but my emotions only get worse as the years go by. I'm just a waste of time and space. I feel like a burden to everyone. I have no friends except a couple online and now I even doubt their intentions and think they just pity me because i'm so paranoid that i'm a burden. 

I can't stop thinking about suicide or ways to do it. I can't stop hurting myself. I do nothing with my shitty life. I just stay at home and almost never go out or have any sort of interaction with actual people. My life used to be so good and I just ruined it all, i'm just a drug addicted fucking failure. I'm so lonely i don't think i can cope much longer, i don't want my mom to feel the pain of losing me because i know she'll end her own life if i do, she has no other proper family. But this pain is too much.",1,"My mother's health is bad and she wants to see me happy before she dies.

221357,"I usually don't post on reddit, kind of scared to thanks to social anxiety leaking into the virtual world as well. But I have nowhere else to turn to right now so I'm forcing myself to post here.

I wholeheartedly believe I have no future. 

I am unemployed, and have no skills employers find desirable(I have been applying to many places for the past three years, trying different tips and tricks I found on the internet on how to make applications more likely to catch an employers eye, listing only relevant past jobs and volunteer work I did in highschool, and am still lucky to just get an email to let me know they don't want me).

I am absolutely dependent on my father for financial support as I don't have a single penny to my name nor a driver's license, but he only makes my emotional and mental state worse.

On the daily, he finds any small reason to blow up and tell me how much of a burden I am, despite doing everything he asks me to do. Dog had a small accident in the hallway, even though I walked them three-four times in two hours like he asked? Obviously I'm at fault and am a useless b!tch, I must have not walked them and lied about it. That's just one example.

He makes me feel like such dead weight, I feel guilty for even eating. So I don't. Why waste precious food that he spent his hard-earned money for on me? I'm already wasting his money by just using the toilet and showering, water bills are a thing.

And God forbid I try to tell him how I'm feeling. Somehow he'll turn it on me, saying I'm crazy, that I'm being disrespectful and ungrateful, that I shouldn't complain because he's keeping a roof over my head.

If I'm this much trouble, maybe everyone would be better off if I just died. No one would have to deal with me again. No one would ever have to carry me again and be disappointed in me again. I'm sick of being a let down. I'm sick of having to face a future that is nothing but a dead-end in a dark hallway.

I'm sorry if I made this too long. I just have nowhere else to express all of this and not be afraid...",1,"Unemployed and dependent on her father for financial support, she is afraid of the future.

221359,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on why I feel this way


Basically, I am a 24 year old female and ever since I was around 12, I've continually for different lengths of time went through periods where all I can think of is commiting suicide. 

Half the time, I do really want to die. I just think my life is terrible and there is no hope for me. I feel like life almost becomes too much, things affects me so much and just the thought of future life challenges just makes me want to end it. Almost as if I'm too weak. It is almost a comforting thought knowing it is an option. 

It is a constant feeling of how could I do it? where can I do it? when? I also think alot about how it'd affect people. When people hurt me, I go to that dark place and think well this would show you how much you've hurt me. Terribly selfish I know. 

The other half of the time I just think about it but I'm fairly certain I'd never do it. 

The times in my life when I don't think about suicide are when I have alot going on. When I have a busy/happy life. When I got to the age of 12 my parents started moving me around alot, so I've spent alot of my life alone. So I think this is what started it. I'm very close to my mum as she has been my best friend all my life but she is generally quite a sad and depressed person so I wonder if that has affected me to..

But even though I'm an adult now, it's still there. It feels like a dark cloud that's always there, waiting. Up until the start of lockdown, I hadn't had those feelings for around 2 years (maybe the occasionaly one but it was the happiest i'd ever been). So yeah, it's back.. how can I fix this? How can I fix myself? I put so much energy into trying to make myself happy but I just feel lost now.",1,"A 24-year-old female has been depressed and suicidal since she was 12 years old.
