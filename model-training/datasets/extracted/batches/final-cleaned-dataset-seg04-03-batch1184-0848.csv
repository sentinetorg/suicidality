160687,Suicidal ideation and mindfulness Are there any objective truths that we know of as to why ending ones own life is  bad  or is that a duality that we ascribe to it as a subjective social norm  should I not worry and decide to end things while I m in a clear state of mind   I took up therapy and meditation a few years ago to help with depression and PTSD  While they ve helped me beyond anything I could imagine  I no longer associate with dualities  self image  my experience of life is much deeper and enjoyable  while this has helped me and I only regret that I didn t learn these things much sooner in my life  I only see more clearly that suicide is a more than justified way out for some  I m   have alienated my friends and family  no relationship  have no real means of financial stability or an education to rely on  I spent   years in the military and struggled to stay off the streets for about   years after that  The issues I have with the life I have created I have dealt with  I accept responsibility for where I m at  but our society does not reward or work in tandem with the objective truths mindfulness uncovers  compassion is looked at as brainwashing and won t get me a Job that pays enough to keep the heat on  I feel like this is the clearest I ve thought about suicide  there s no emotion of sadness  or some freedom I think would attain from it  I simply just want out while I m at least able to feed myself,1,Suicide is a justified way out for some people. I took up therapy and meditation a few years ago to help with depression and PTSD. I regret that I didn't learn these things sooner in my life.

Mindfulness is looked at as brainwashing and won't get me a job that pays enough to keep the heat on.,suicide justified way people take therapy meditation year ago help depression pt regret not learn thing soon life society not reward work tandem objective truth mindfulness uncover mindfulness look brainwash not job pay heat
