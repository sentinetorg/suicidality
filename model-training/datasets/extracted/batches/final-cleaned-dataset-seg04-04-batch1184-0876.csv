221255,"Is there anything I can do via Reddit to report a suicide plan someone has told me about?

I’m using an alternate account to ask this in case the other person is following my main and might see this. 

Over the last couple of months a younger kid, I think he’s 14? Has been messaging me here and there. He’s said some questionable things in the course of this, but nothing I’m sure he’s serious about. It seems more for shock value. Tbh, I’d prefer not to speak to him, but he occasionally mentions suicide and we chat back and forth until he seems to come up with alternate ideas about maybe speaking to his doctor to request a med change, or reaching out to someone at school... anyway, today he told me he has a plan. I’m not even sure what country he lives in, but I wish there was a way to find his parents. In lieu of that, is there any sort of reporting system in reddit?

Edit to add: I’m reposting this because it got removed from no stupid questions, I didn’t know this sub existed. I looked at the kids profile, he’s actually a little younger than I thought, but all his posts are suicide related for the most part. But he told me he has a plan and plans to do it on Wednesday. So really is there anything else to be done?",1,"A 14-year-old kid has been messaging me here and there recently. He's said some questionable things, but nothing serious.

221256," Since 2018 my dad and my mom have been fighting over him marrying another woman behind his back and this has caused a severe ripple in our family. They've been fighting back and fourth and my dad refused to do anything about the relationship between him, my mom, and the other woman. They've been on and off again with fights and arguments but things didn't really get bad until this year. After my dad revealed he was going to pay for another apartment for my mom to live in so he could separate himself and his family away from my mother, she flew into a frenzy throwing slurs at him until he ended up pushing my mother and yelling at me and my two sisters that if she says anything to divide us he will leave us and never come back. This all happened at the time of me making this post and idk what to do. I've also noticed my sisters growing an increased resentment for my father and slowly but surely giving him a lot more flak for his behavior, but he swears and even sometimes threatens them with violence to make sure they don't go against him.

221270,"Hey I’m not sure if this is the right place to post but I can’t talk to anyone I know about this. So Wednesday night at about between the hours of 9 and 10. I consumed an almost 3 month supply of my blood pressure medicine, (lisinopril 40mg). 

I’ve done this before but back then I was only getting a months supply at a time and I ended up sending out messages to my family and wound up in the er. This time however I just drank until I fell asleep. I did this on impulse, I wasn’t planning it up until like 1 or 2 hours before I did it. 

Well I woke up around 6 am shaking in a cold sweat. I could hardly walk but I made it to the bathroom to puke my guts out. It was a rough day but I managed to call in sick work (which I never do) and convince my wife that it was just alcohol withdrawal.
Anyway I looked up the half-life and it’s 12 hours. It’s been close to 48 hours and I’m still here. I don’t feel suicidal anymore but I don’t want this to happen again because it’ll just keep escalating until it works. Seeing a therapist has never helped me.

I'm so fucking terrified man. Not of death at all. I mean fuck that's the only escape we've got. That little back pocket portal out of existence. The fear everyday comes from failure in the future coming from failure now. In HS I really didn't give a shit about grades so I just kindov worked my ass off in minimum wage the second I turned 15 (I'm 19 now). I guess I got so used to the mindlessness of it that once I graduated I had nothing to show for. I've been In CC since and I've been doing ""ok"" in my GE classes. My major jumped back and forth so nothing hasn't really been focused. First Screenwriting, then fear of failure scared the shit out of me - So I tried to set up classes to be a doctor, then the fear of failure scared the shit out of me - So now I've been goin for Comp Sci, and holy shit is the fear creeping. I mean you know - you look up a degree someone got and they give their war story of how they wish they never even tried. Yah that's not everyone, but with the string of bad luck and bad choices a guy can make, who says that'll just magically stop. And for the grades, fucking christ, you get a C you feel like you're some fuckin degenerate compared to these trust fund mother fuckers. I'm not as suicidal as I have been in HS, mostly due to my Heroin addict brother who tried to kill me a few times and then my mom gaslighted me, finally getting kicked out for the last time. But man can I feel it wrapping back around me almost like a comforting blanket. Death means I can just stop. Just Stop thinking, just stop worrying, just stop being so god damn worthless. If classes don't work out then its either suicide or Navy for me. I just can't live my life under someone else's fuckin boot anymore (I get the irony with Navy but hey I might feel like I'm doing something worthwhile for once).

221288,"Im so jealous of missing girls. I’ve been seeing and retweeting so many missing and murdered people and even though I hope for THEIR safety and families, I want it to happen to me. I want someone to kidnap and kill me or SOMETHING. I want my family to be able to find the body and put it to rest but I wanna be dead. I just wanna be shot in the face or something. I keep hearing about kidnappers and I’m mad that no one has got me yet.

I have ran away from home like twice after heated arguments and got into cars of random dudes in hopes they take me somewhere and kill me but they were just dudes looking for fucks and I was highly disappointed. Also I left home once to go to a spot where I planned to hang myself and a guy picked me up and bought me a lighter then went somewhere kinda public but dark. He wanted to fuck and I hoped he’d shoot me or something after refusing but he obviously didn’t.

I hate being alive so bad.",1,There are many missing and murdered people and I want it to happen to me. I want someone to kidnap and kill me or something.

I suffer from bipolar type 2 and I can't deal with this depression anymore.  All the changes thst have happened since the pandemic and the quarantine have been tough for me to deal with. I'm trying to keep myself together but I'm falling apart.

I don't want to be sad anymore. I have this aching feeling in my chest that won't go away. I try so hard to be a good wife, mom and friend but everyone expects me to be so happy and friendly and a lot of days I just can't.

Was just reading about yet another suicide of a well-known person and realizing how much worse I have it than others. Yet no one would mourn me if I go. All the same mental issues apply, but I don’t matter. I’m so tired of people throwing around the suicide hotline like it makes a difference. A phone number won’t change cold, hard facts.

221296,"No one truly cares about you until you're gone... This has been a universal truth since the beginning of man. No one wants to acknowledge your mental illness or need for support even though you're clearly signaling for help, instead most will ridicule you and treat your call for help as a cry for attention because they lack the empathy and intelligence to understand and perceive the world as through your perspective.

Once it's too late some will show their condolences and craft fake statements in an attempt to convince themselves that they really cared about you, all to validate themselves as ""good people"". These people never once had you cross their mind during their days until you passed, but as soon as you die you all of a sudden meant so much to them, and that you were such a huge inspiration to them.

I dont know if I dont care at all, or if I care too much. 

I dont know why Im hurting so much. 

I dont know what to do against it, how to ease the pain without giving it over to others. 

And Im afraid. Im so fucking afraid. 

Im afraid that Ill always feel this way, that it never gets better, because truth be told, my life couldnt be much better. I have great friends and family, a job I love that pays well, my own awesome flat, a therapist, hobbies and interests, I got it all...

Im afraid one day I dont have the strength to carry on anymore. That one day I lose my battle, because I can win everyday and have to fight the next, but if I lose once, its over. 

Im afraid to let people in, because I fear I will hurt them eventually. Im afraid of what it will do to my mother, my brother, my sister, my friends. 

And most of all Im afraid this day is today...
