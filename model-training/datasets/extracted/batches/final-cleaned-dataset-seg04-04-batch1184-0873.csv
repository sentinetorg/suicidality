221102,Why am I always just sad? I haven't had a day where I haven't felt like I should just disappear. I just watch videos about suicide online and how easy it is. I've even thought about what I'd write on my note that I'd leave behind. I have a friend who knows about what I feel like but after I told him I still felt empty. I've tried telling my parents but I chickened out after crying a bit. By the way this is my first post on Reddit and might be my last depending on how I feel after posting this.

221104,"Would it be wrong to kill myself if I never had nothing going on for my life?. 

Would it be wrong to *kms* because I'm a **loser** in life. 

My parents never gave a shit about me. 
Besides giving the stuff that I need to survive as if I were their pet.

Just so u can re-live another day where you can get the chance to get a normal life

I was home-schooled half of 
7th, 8th, & 9th grade because of the lack of social skills that I had, social anxiety and later on depression
This lasted around 7th - 10th grade. 

Taking this online school made me graduate high-school early at the age of 15.
 (I kind of cheated through it though)
But I still got an easy Diploma

I'd say for two years of my life I did nothing. 

From the ages of 15 through 16

Until I reached the age of 17.
I did do one year of college for hospitality management 

Likewise. Things did not get better for me since then

I am still both socially awkward, isolated and depressed.
I am bored of life. helpless.❤ I have no friends, in which whom I can't relate to. 

I live for what I like and love to eat. I barely have any hobbies besides cooking, singing, and drawing a little and watching YouTube. 

My parents are very little when it comes to acknowledging my future. 

Would it be wrong to kill myself even tho I got nothing going on for life? I am used to being depressed, Even though I am a stronger person for who I was before

221107,"I am done and want to end it. Of course I have a lot of debt from a credit card and with parents. Goal is to make sure family is safe from retaliation from law enforcement and debt collectors. 

Living in California

I would like to liquidate my assets (car and cheap/old apartment furnishings) to give to parents tax free to off set damages. Cash, bond, ira savings, trust fund? Best way to maximize approximately $15,000 for family?

How can I protect family against retaliation from credit card company? I am the only signer on one credit card and a cosigner with mother to one with a different credit card company and bank. 

Can Law Enforcement retaliate against family or investigate/tax/seize liquidated assets?

I am a cosigner for an apartment with my father until middle of next year, what's the best way to shield family from leasing agency retaliation?

It's safe to assume that committing suicide on private property is a huge headache for business owners. However the most effective way I can see to guarantee death would be to rent a gun from range and leave the body in an easily sanitized area.  Goal is to go quietly and efficiently with as little concern from others as possible and as cheaply as possible. Would a gun range have liability immunity in this case?

Finally I want to guarantee the body be recycled/donated and no memorial/funeral service is conducted. Do I need a lawyer to be executor of this or can I simply get a notary or cheaper/simpler alternative?

221110,"I either live until I die naturally or I kill myself. Neither makes any difference to me or the universe.

Living is hard. Circumstances don't matter, I just hate living. I used to think I felt bad because of external reasons but I've come to understand that I just hate existence itself.

Suicide is freedom. 

Suicide is easy.

Suicide is selfish.

It would destroy my father and my sister. I love them. I don't want to hurt them. 

But that in and of itself does not allow me to keep living. 

It's equally selfish to make them my reason to live. That implies that whenever I get hurt me it's their fault for forcing me to be alive. Eventually I'll come to hate them for forcing me to endure the pain of being alive. Sometimes I already do.

I can't die because of them, but I also can't live a life I hate just because of them. 

To go on living I need to make peace with myself and find my own motivation. Nobody else can do that for me, and I don't know how to do it myself. My only other options are suicide or killing myself with anti depressants. The part of me that hates being alive is me. Without it I'll just be an empty shell of a human.",1,I hate living.

221132,"I don't know why I keep having these thoughts. But the way people have hurt me make me wonder... if I died, would they finally care about me? Would they finally throw themselves on their bed and bawl for hours?

I'm sick of thinking about them. I want their memories erased from my head. But until then, it makes me want to die. I wish I could escape this world. I think of the fun times I had with my friends... until they just suddenly left me. And they didn't speak to me at all. It was dizzying. If I were to die, perhaps they would finally feel the same pain...

At the same time, I realize how fucked up I sound. I'm sick of these thoughts. They keep coming up, no matter how much I tell my head to stop spiraling into that sort of thinking process.

Even if they aren't empathetic it's a win-win. I would be dead, and they would finally be rid of me.",1,"If I were to die, people would finally care about me.

My mental health decided to take a  trip to Aruba and is not coming back. I tried to talk about my depression to my parents, the first time when I was 16 they found me selfharming and I had to tell them, they hit me and told me they already had 2 dysfunctional children ( I have two disabled slibings) and I was being lazy (I always help with housechores, babysit and I was the top student in high school) and that I should move out. I tried to talk to my mother of this years later and she told me “why don’t just get a gun and kill yourself”. Now when they think I’m sad they tell me to just get over it.

I’m failing at everything am doing right now, I can’t concentrate because I just wanna cry. I’m not living for myself, the only thing that keeps me alive is knowing that without me my slibings won’t have nobody to take care of them when my parents pass away.

She couldn't stay with him so I offered her a bed at my house. A place where she could be safe. (Ex boyfriend came by mutual friends and broke out his front windows).

I am diagnosed with, depression, psychosis, and aspergers.

While I was at the doctor's office, I was playing on a video game, while this girl came in with her mother, but this girl had autism, and she was around 30 years old,  she saw me playing my game and sat next to me watching me play it, not saying anything. She liked video games as well, her mom was talking to my own mom about her daughter, she said she never had friends and that she was often bullied at school. She just wanted a friend, she just wanted someone to have memories with, she just wanted something she never had before. And what did my stupid piece of useless shit do? I ignored her, I ignored her while she was watching me play my game, I ignored her when she told me bye in the saddest voice I ever heard. Her mom also said she was gonna get sent to foster care, because her mom couldn't take care of her anymore. I never seen her again after that, all these thoughts rushed through my head, what if she killed herself because I didn't wanna be her friend? What if she's being abused in a foster home? What if she's dead? All because of my idiotic stupidity, someone could potentially be dead because of me. 

And my mom told she doesn't know what happened to her, I just don't wanna live my entire life wondering if someone could potentially be dead because of me, and also living slowly being eaten by my own guilt.
