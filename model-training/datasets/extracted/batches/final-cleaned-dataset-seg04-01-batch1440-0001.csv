It is so sad to see other people caught in between caring so deeply for others and caring so little for themselves that it actually becomes detrimental in itself.

All that shit made a difference.Why am I saying this?Because the little things help. Fuck society, fuck their expectations.

13,"I was 15 when I was arrested. Wasnt a good student or a good offspring, but I really turned myself around my last two years of high school. I still got suspended two more times, for doing stupid things, but thats just life. As cheesy as it sounds, whatever doesnt kill you just makes you stronger. And I think that because you are still young, you will have plenty of chances to screw up and try to better yourself. I would actually encourage doing more stupid things, because they make for good stories later in life and they allow you do look back at what kind of person you were and give advice to people who happen to be in similar situations. Also, when the time does come around, for you to help someone, you will see that this mistake that you made, getting arrested, is actually what is helping you help your friend. Not gonna lie, youre gonna feel terrible over and over again. Sometimes you will lie in bed running through the arrest over and over again in your head and think about what you could have done or said to get out of it. Where you went wrong in life, but you will eventually accept that it happen and move on.I encourage you to PM me so that we can talk more.",0,I was 15 when I was arrested.

28,"You know what you should do?Instead of thinking about killing yourself, just pack up your stuff, and leave.  Leave everything behind.  Dont let this be the end of your life, but the start of a new one.  Dont ""live on the street"", find a hotel to stay at, hitchhike, rent a car, whatever.   And your family probably doesnt think of you as a burden.  Imagine a burden you would be if you killed yourself; Depression on everyone, further financial problems with funeral costs and such, etc.Also think of dying this way: you will be sent into oblivion forever.  No, you wont know it, but you will not EXIST anymore.  Not eating, breathing, running, anything. Make your existence meaningful and dont throw it away carelessly. I hope you can find your way out of this. I can understand that. You would rather take your own life than die from drugs. Society is fucked up and I hate having to conform what ""right"" and ""normal"" to society. Sorry if I come off as annoying, I just know there are better and more options than just choosing death. You just have to find them.  That last option (besides dying on the battlefield) actually sounds like a great idea.  Just find away to leave (even fighting ISIS). Find something that doesnt require any sort of payment (since I am in a large amount of debt also, I know how you feel).Basically getting away from this awful sounding family of yours and finding your own purpose in life, instead of letting it slip away.I really wish you good luck. But you did make it, once.  Doesnt mean you should give it another try.  Give life another chance, I believe in you.  Despite all of these shortcomings, youve still managed to make it this far.

30,"So should I bank on the slight chance that it does get better? Thats why Ill stay alive long term? Ive been like this for four years, with constant Suicidal thoughts. Tried two therapists and meds. There isnt a single external factor, Im okay in school, body image is fine. And Id prefer it to be a permanent, mindless solution- that would make things far much easier. The alternative of staying alive for years and years and years sounds far FAR worse. Yeah, Im a senior in HS, etc, etc, but its like a fucking PART of me and as time continues it just gets worse. I honestly dont care. I dont know why I replied. Yes, I guess I dont want to Pain them either. It always seems like a double edged sword, since if I were to die I could burden them less. Although I dont know how grief works. I dont know.  Ive thought about it a lot, I wouldnt feel sad if either my siblings or parents die. Perhaps a little guilty because I may have been able to do something, but not so far as grief or sadness. I mentioned to my (ex)therapist two years ago that I was considering hanging myself and she brought in my mother and told her. It was ridiculous, she started freaking out. Aside from that, no, I dont like talking about this stuff. I hate burdening everyone all the time.Also- Ive come to conclusion that Im not going to die until my younger brother gets accepted into a good college (hes on an ivy league track), dont want to fuck with his chances, so my parents can finally feel some pride and self accomplishment for once. Ill just drone through life until then. Thanks guys, for responding and caring like this.  Well, I wouldnt be here if my parents were okay with suicide. My point- expressing the frustration that so many people think about suicide and still remain alive. I have a hard time grasping the fact that others can move on with their lives and have the same mental blocks, while I cant handle them. ",1,Suicide is a constant part of a senior's mind.

Over the past year I developed severe ED too, which I never had problems with in my 20s.  I missed the boat on ever having a intimate relationship, and there isnt much hope for one in the future.   Im 30 and feel the same way.  I think most suicides are irrational and do fit the description of ""a Injury of muscle fix to a temporary problem""  This is ESPECIALLY true in younger people.  But in some cases I think suicide can be a rational decision.  I have spent a LOT of time in introspection and I have come to the conclusion suicide is the best way out in my case.  Im just too high inhibition to go through with it.  And so Im stuck in a perpetual case of limbo.    In my case, I have never experienced love or intimacy, and Im 30.

Firstly you should focus on the most important thing in your life...you! Do not try to get the attention of others. You are so young and new to life and there is so much out there for you. Life is made up of both good and bad experiences. Everyone has good and bad in thier lives. No one has a perfect life. You have to have good and bad so that as you mature you will be able to deal with the things you may come against in life both good and bad.

It just doesnt work like that.  Of course, acute situations can push someone to committing suicide and that is what I would worry about.Im not sure what your financial situation is, but seeing a professional is the best thing I can recommend. Not just once, but consistently.  Youre not alone. People feel like this all the time. Its not to minimize how much Pain your in, but to empower you to know that there are people who recover, people who grab ahold of all the things you wish you could feel.  It sounds like self-esteem plays a big role in how you feel: calling yourself a pussy, not feeling comfortable around women, etc.  I can assure you that being in a relationship isnt the key to getting over it (and people who say to ""get over it"" should be kicked in the shins!)
