Where associates and peers are constantly dating, moving on with their lives; and they just give me *that* look. If I dont initiate contact, contact is *never* made, beyond pleasantries.  It never goes anywhere.  Friendships ended when I stopped calling.  No one shows any romantic/sexual interest, unless theyre a good looking dude behind me.I think Im eventually just going to get fed up and buy a gun.  That seems way easier than jumping, a bit more control over when and where.I was where you were at your age, well, mostly. Give or take.

There are people out there who care. Is money the issue? Because although it would help, therapy and western medicine isnt the only option. Answer me please, tell me what treatment you have gotten  for feeling this way? You are not alone. I have been where you are many times.  Good psychs are really hard to find. But they do exist. Might I suggest, look around for any Buddhist centres/temples in your city, see if you can go to a group session to learn meditation from a Buddhist monk/guru.  Thank you kindly silentlyundying OP is posting to Suicide watch. She is clearly feeling hopeless. OP is after support, not criticism. I would give you support too if you were in the same situation.

The trouble with Suicide is that it is so bloody final! Just because you have tried hard to get better and it hasnt been sucessful yet doesnt Irritable Mood that you will never feel better.

Not a lot of what you are saying makes sense and if you think about it its probably far more likely that your past mental health problems are reoccurring than a Anger relative has it in for you. Why do you want it then?  I strongly suspect that you are rationalising your feelings rather than really analysing anything.  You know that feeling of being really scared? If you can overcome it and tell your parents anyway then you you will have made a huge step forwards. Brave people arent fearless. They have the fear but do it anyway. You could try showing them this post initially. Once you get it off your chest , that alone should make you feel a whole lot better. They love you right? So theyll want to help you.
