220956,"Hi, it's my first post here, I'm new in this community. So... I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now. Today is my 25th birthday. Things have been extremely bad lately. I lost my job that I adored and I feel useless because of unemployment, I live in a country where unemployment rates are extremely high and my field of work doesn't have many opportunities. Even outside of it, it's hard to find work. I feel hopeless and it has made my suicidal thoughts much worse.

I actually plan to do it tonight. I had a shitty birthday and I really don't need to live a day more. Leading up to today, I've broken up with my girlfriend and pushed my family members away from me as much as possible, so it will lessen their pain. It hurts a lot, but it's for their own good.

I've tried therapy and medication, it helped briefly but my psychiatrist told me that my depression will keep coming back easily, I have family history of depression and suicide so it's no wonder. I can't keep going through this and bringing down my loved ones. I can't keep living like this.

I guess the reason I made this post is to vent. I don't know if I'm actually going to go through it tonight. I hope I'll be able to. My feelings have gone numb and I just want to close my eyes forever. I called a suicide hotline and the operator tried to guilt me into staying alive by telling me all about how my family will miss me... I know they will, but it will pass with time. I'm very worried about them, but I can't keep living for them. It's been the only reason I've kept living all these years... I can't do this anymore.

So, tonight might be the end. Sorry for venting. I'm keeping it a secret, obviously, but I felt like I had to tell someone, even anonymously on reddit. Goodbye.",1,Today is my 25th birthday.

220958,"I assume the person cutting is a girl but i‚Äôm not sure. I was scrolling through random hashtags about adhd because i have it. Then in a post i clicked a self harming hashtag. Then I saw her profile with 2 or 3 posts of her cutting herself. Very new, and its been 6 days since she‚Äôs first made the profile.

First attempt talking:
Titles herself as an unwanted person. She wants help, and I saw it and I fucking had to do something. I couldn‚Äôt just leave someone crying for heIp. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her using knowledge I‚Äôve read online. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me and replies with ‚Äúidk‚Äù constantly. So i said I‚Äôll leave her and told her to think about seeking a professional. Told her to remember it‚Äôll pass and some other things. So i stopped talking for 2 days.

Second attempt:
I came back to her profile account, and saw her new posts. She was trying to talk to me through her captions accompanied by photos with more cuts. She said ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt help me no one can‚Äù and ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. 

So i messaged her/him again asking if she thought about seeking professional help yet. She wrote ‚Äúabout?‚Äù and ‚Äúty‚Äù and asked how old i was. She then posted on her profile page again with ‚Äúi need you but you don‚Äôt seem to need me üôÉüî´‚Äù with more fucking cuts...probably because it took me a while to respond since i didn‚Äôt see it. 
Back to the private messages. I said i was 19. She‚Äôs seen my message and hasn‚Äôt responded for about 4 hours now.

I then texted ‚Äúdo you live with your family‚Äù just recently. I need help right now. I need as much help to stop this, I can‚Äôt let this go. I‚Äôm not experienced with this, i only messaged her because i was the only one who has seen it. This is so sad.",1,"A girl has been posting about self harming on her profile page for 6 days.

220987,"I want to kill myself because everything seems to go wrong. Everyone has an easier life than me, and everywhere I go, I'm being treated like garbage by other women. There is no job that I want to do, which would bring me joy. I just want to die because then, I wouldn't have to worry about this. 

I live alone with my mother, and she has been abusing me consistently. My family talks shit about me or don't reach out to me at all ever since I was a kid. My father is rich, but he never gave me a cent, and I haven't seen him in 10 years. I don't have many friends left, and those who are left, they are not my real friends or have their own life. Every job I start, I'm being abused. I'd like to go to university, but I have no money, and I want to earn money, a lot of money. 

My mother works in a bad place, and she has her own issues with our family and at work. 

I don't know anymore. My last hope is to sell my body, as sad as it sounds. But then, I don't even want to do that. I just feel horrible. I had a bad experience with drugs months ago, and ever since then, my mind seems to go crazy, like I'm bordering on psychosis and not trying to slip from reality. Yesterday night, I couldn't fall asleep and had a paranoia attack, similar to when I was tripping.

And the ironic part is... I don't even hate other people. I would like to have many friends and enjoy life again. I would like to work in a good place and have a happy family. And I would like to travel. But no matter what I do, I feel like everything is failing, and I end up at the same miserable place. Hence why I want to take my own life finally.",1,"I want to kill myself because everything seems to go wrong for me. I live alone with my mother, and she has been abusing me consistently.

It doesn't get better. If anything it gets worse and worse. 
The universe has decided to screw me over yet again.
My sister is dead, my beloved little sister, the one that came to me every time she had problems. The one that I had to go visit in the hospital every few months every time she attempted to kill herself

And now she's gone.

And I'm fucking pregnant.

Life can't possibly get any worse, but I'm not willing to stick around just to prove it.

This will be my last message. I'm sorry mom that you had to suffer this much. I though I could stick around for you.

But you will learn to live. You are strong. You are loved. 

I'll always be with you. 

Thank you everyone for the amazing support. This time is the last. Ignore this post and go respond to people who still have a chance. Tying my knot right now.

Okay I'm inside. It's kinda hard but I think I did it right.

220994,"I am going to drop out of university. Failed first semester,  terrified me, was behind and then did nothing in the 2nd because I was scared of failure, had no interest in the course and due to corona online classes gave me even less motivation. I know it is all my fault. I am not going to even attempt the exams. The first one would be in 2 weeks and I didn't attend any classes except 2 and didn't study and I can't catch up anyways. 
I don't know what to do. I feel like I have no future anymore.

I have no idea what to do in the future, my parents won't accept any of it. They wasted money on me going to uni just to fail and I feel guilty and I don't know what to do in the future.

220996,"I‚Äôve been fighting a war that I can‚Äôt win. Depression, suicide attempts, alcoholism, and compulsive gambling. I took a really hard look in the mirror and realized my time here is coming in an end. No one can talk me out of it this time. My first attempt was a little over two years ago (thanks to my partner at the time screaming ‚Äúfucking kill yourself‚Äù) and I‚Äôm so tired of the pain and loss.

The pain of having a long term partner cheat. The pain of my best friend overdosing. The pain of losing all trust in myself. I can‚Äôt go without a day about thinking about dying.

Once I made the plans and wrote out what I need to do before I go (write letters, clean, make amendments, etc.) I finally felt peace. There‚Äôs a tremendous amount of happiness surrounding the idea that I won‚Äôt be here much longer. Happy tears. It‚Äôs a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

The addict inside me needs to be stopped. The suicide hotline hung up on me. My regular therapist that I‚Äôve been seeing for two years is quitting his practice. My dreams have been crushed. I‚Äôm in debt. This is the final chapter- I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôve fought too long and it‚Äôs time to give up.

I don‚Äôt want to be 25 and already have more relapses than I can count. I‚Äôm done failing. I‚Äôm done disappointing others. I‚Äôm done causing conflicts that could be easily avoidable if I was simply not me. I love everything and everyone, but I truly hate what‚Äôs in the mirror. My mind is constantly persuaded by guilt and hate. The things I do are singular, detached from anything and everyone. There‚Äôs no origin. No one‚Äôs fault but my own. Remember that.

 And with this said, I say goodbye. It‚Äôs a sweet goodbye like a sunset after a long day at the beach. It needs to happen- innately natural, at least to me. I am at peace and I see happiness on the horizon. I am going to feel the love that I‚Äôve always wanted.",1,"Suicide is coming to an end for 25-year-old man.

I‚Äôve stopped taking my meds and I‚Äôm tired of waiting for death. I‚Äôm sick and I know it. My physicality is getting worse. My mentality is declining to its lowest brink. My last resort is to tell someone who lives close enough to save me, but nobody that cares about me lives close enough. To die, alone, freezing because of the air conditioner, in pain, depressed, and feeling as if I deserved it. 

It‚Äôs fine.

I deserve it, so it‚Äôs okay.
