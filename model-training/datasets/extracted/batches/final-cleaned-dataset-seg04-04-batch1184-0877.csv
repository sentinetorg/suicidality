221302,"I feel like every decision I take is the wrong decision. I feel like my world has been crumbling around me slowly and I’m just tired of worrying and stressing. My family is in the lower class and we’ve always struggled. I slept on the floor until I got my first bed when I was 10. I know people have been worse but that’s just kinda putting it into a perspective. I can’t help but feel like even when I’ve got it good, right around the corner is something waiting to ruin my happiness. Right now I’m in the middle though, I just got a new job so I’m finally able to feel like I’m worth something but I just keep worrying about the worst like I’m going to get fired or something. The other day while I was working someone really sketchy walked in and for a second I was actually scared. Then just 5 seconds later my brain took a tole to who cares if I die. If I get shot and die it’s whatever. Just a very passive suicide kind of mindset. I don’t want to get into the problems of my life but today has been a terrible day and today just seems like a good day to say fuck it. I guess in the end I just feel like I’m walking on thin ice and like at any moment I’ll be some bum on the streets all alone. I feel like I have no backup and like if I ever fell no one would be there to back me up. I kinda feel alone. I’m not alone, but I feel alone. Life is a series of random events, but I feel like the bad out weighs the good. I’m just tired of stressing out and worrying. The sad part is I’m only 18 so I know there’s plenty more of that coming my way. I just feel trapped and doomed to fail.

But when I imagine myself rich and successful that doesn’t really make me happy either

I just don’t want life . It’s tiring and what’s for ? To die I’m the end so why not die now?

221306,"I have been thinking about suicide alot again. I have been suicidal before in my teens because of depression, social anxiety, and i got bullied alot. Now i'm 20 and have been out of school for 2 years and i work now. I felt alot better not having to go to school anymore. Because of my 0 social skills i decided to become a trucker and i enjoyed it at first. But now i'm extremely lonely. I have no friends and I always work alone. When i get home from work i just sit in my room browsing reddit and watching youtube (even in the weekends). I'm just in this cycle of working alone -> going home sitting alone in my room -> work  -> home .... I don't do anything and i feel like a slave just working and then going to his cell. I am feeling very suicidal again and i decided that i don't want to go down that path again. So i quit my job, my last day is 31/7. I have no idea what i'm going to do after. I'm just lost. I also needed a hobby, something to do. So i bought a [Paramotor](https://www.vliegles.nl/images/thumbnails/product_image-2348-1500x844.jpg), I have been wanting to fly for a long time but never did it because it is expensive. Now i just said fuck it and spend like all my money on it. Parents think i'm crazy but whatever. I hope i can figure out how to be happy. But if i don't a paramotor is a nice way to commit suicide. When flying you literally have death at your fingertips. I can just crash the thing from high altitude and ill be dead. Also it will look like an accident so people won't think i'm a loser that commited suicide but just had an accident. Thanks for spending the time reading this.

I've talked about them recently because it's what they say I should do. They say to let people in. To talk. I've made a plan and I have to get it out of my head so I'm posting here.

This time though, I've made a plan. I have a month to write my letters, get my financial things in order, and cover any loose ends.

 Everything hurts so much and I just want to be alone. I can’t stand being around people, even my two closest friends are becoming too much for me to handle. 
I can never get the thoughts in my head to go away. Vivid imagery of me harming myself, or my lifeless body hanging from something are just becoming too much for me. I’m worried one of these days I’m going to impulsively kill myself. 
I want to self harm. I miss the familiar sting of the blade slicing my skin open.
Tomorrow my girlfriend invited me to come swimming in her aunts pool. Right now, that’s the only thing stopping me from playing butcher with my body. I don’t want them to see, and be ashamed or feel bad for me.

221339,"I cut. a lot. Its gotten worse over the months, probably started in early February when quarantine hit Utah and schools became online. i never was much of a talker, i have a few friends here and there but not many. i don't do dating, my mental heath wasn't great to begin with so i didn't want to get rejected because i was the quiet kid. I was fine before the panic of COVID-19 started, and a couple weeks after it started i got depressed. Like i said, I wasn't social, so what was the problem? my theory is a lot of shit happening in two weeks that pushed me over the edge. My father isn't the nicest, not abusve, physically, but mentally. I didn't have high esteem to born with, I was never told to be proud of what i've done so i wasn't. My dad and my mom got divorced on Christmas, they thought it was a good idea to tell me, my brother, and my sister (both younger than me) after opening out presents and i was 13 thinking, ""why wouldn't they tell me first?"" but my mom said it was for the best. The next thing was two weeks after Covid was my grandpa died when his heart went out. it didn't really hit me until a week later, when i started cutting. I always loathed going to my fathers because every day i would be yelled at for messing something up. he has this thing where he thinks that if he yells, it get to my head better. it doesn't. he's also a reason why i started cutting. thats all for right now, im tired and just want to sleep, I will edit this if someone really does care to add more",1,In February quarantine hit Utah and schools became online.

221343,"a month ago, I had a plan to kill myself. I went to the local crisis center instead. the people there were kind and all, but they didn't take me seriously.

the counselor I spoke to told me he doesn't think I'm depressed and kept telling me that killing myself would be stupid because it wouldn't solve anything. which I know is technically true, but it felt so dismissive. like he thought I was stupid for feeling the way I did.

we set up a time for him to call the next day and check in, but he said he wouldn't be concerned if I didn't answer. that hurt. I felt like he didn't believe my situation was serious. that or he just didn't care.

before I left, he asked if I still wanted to kill myself. I told him yes. and he just sent me on my way.

he called the next day, and we set up a time for one last check in the following day. but no one ever called. and honestly, that hurt. I'd had a really bad night and was counting on that call. which I guess was stupid on my part. I know it was a free service and I shouldn't complain. I just feel so hurt.

it took everything I had to ask for help. I had never asked for help before. and they wouldn't help me. because I guess I'm not ""sick"" enough. I go to work every day and I take care of my responsibilities and that means I can't really be depressed or in crisis or deserving of help. I left the center feeling like I had taken resources away from someone who was more deserving.

I'm suffering so much and I want to die and I asked for help but it wasn't enough. that was my only option. my only chance.

Me: *goes to my room and cuts, stabs, and burns myself to relieve the pain of them hating me*

I got almost beaten to death by members of a big local family clan.When I just tried to save someone else they wanted to kick to death.The lawsuit against them didnt even go before a court before it was shut  down. 

I now have a giant scar on my head and still half a tooth missing. Also I lost my job back then because of PTSD . 

Two uncles of mine died in january and my mother succumbed to her cancer after 3years of fighting.I am currently without work and hadn't much luck finding a new job.Also I am living with a friend of mine ,sleeping on his couch ,crammed between all my stuff in boxes. 

I am burned out ,I dont even wish to talk to anyone anymore ,lost many friends over the last years ,some through their drug habbits ,others through my social anxiety. 

I feel fucking burned out. Like I wont kill myself as that would make life only harder for my family. But fuck do I think about ending it alot.

221347,"Life. 

I have attempted suicide about 6 times in the past 10 years. Two got me in the hospital and then a psych ward. Since I was a teenager, I’ve felt the ‘Call of the Void’. I’ve been self harming near consistently for over 10 years. I also became a drug addict and alcoholic. I was very deep into it for about 4 years. I am just over 1 year sober now. I didn’t care when I got my 1 year date. I don’t care about anything. I have royally fucked myself in my schooling program. I am so ashamed by that, that I asked around to see if anyone had a gun for sale. One did. I was going to exchange all my benzodiazepines and adderall for it. 

I only didn’t because of my girlfriend. In a way I hate her. She’s the only reason I’m still here. Her mom is in the hospital on a respirator for COVID. And her social circle is having major issues. But I also I truly love her. Like, she’s the one. When I think about her and what state she’d be if I killed myself, I am overcome with self hatred and fear that I no longer have the option to kill Myself.

The drugs really messed with brain. My short term memory barely exists, I get auditory hallucinations, and Im just not as smart anymore. I’ve permanently messed up my head. And I’m 25. With my messed up brain, this messed up world, and the knowledge that it won’t get better, I have thoughts about killing myself more so than ever before. I’m in-between passively and actively suicidal. 

I have a good life, by any persons terms. But I’m scared of everything. And it almost seems smarter to end my life. I’m extremely conflicted. And I can’t use crisis line as I used to volunteer there. I don’t mind if no one comments on this. I just needed to get it out. I just don’t want to feel so bad anymore.",1,"At 25, I'm in-between passively and actively suicidal.
