221001,This is my second post on this sub. I keep trying to be a better boyfriend but even though my girlfriend tells me I am a great boyfriend I feel like a waste of space. I have my next therapy appointment in 4 weeks but I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna make it that long. I hate everything about myself. So if I canâ€™t even love myself why should anyone else. I despise waking up in the morning just so I have to look at myself in the mirror and be reminded of the waste of oxygen that lies before me. I just want a break from life and the longest break I can think of is death. I want to feel something anything.,1,This is the second post on this sub. It's written by a boyfriend who hates himself.

I've even tried to hang myself but it just won't work. Why? I am so tired. Both physically and mentally. Good people die every day. People who want to live life and have dreams and here I am.

221004,"Iv been depressed for many years on and off. Past few months it wont leave, i have lost my partner in the most brutal way, lost my family my kids and everything i have. I am a shell of my former self. 

I have come to the realisation that i will never be happy. I will never have the family and the love i have always craved. I keep questioning why others have people who love them and stay together for life while i get brutally fucked over by the people i love the most. 

I cant take it anymore. I am alone, and will be alone forever. 
My friends are not really that close, my parents have never liked me or made effort and the woman i loved for so long and gave everything i had to wouldnt care if i lived or died (she actually said this). 

I find no joy or happiness in anything any more. I dont feel any love or kindness from anyone. This world has chewed me up and spat me out more than once. I have been knocked time an time again. I kept getting back up like they tell you too but not this time. 

Im circling the drain of death, if i didnt have 3 children who would be hurt by my passing i would of already gone. 

Last ditch attempt of counseling and medication. Im thinking of setting a date. Say 6 months from now. I know time is a healer and i will feel better in time. However if things havnt drastically improved within 6 months i think its time.  

Anyone else ever set a end state timer?",1,"Iv has been depressed for many years on and off. In the past few months he has lost his partner, his family, his kids and everything he has.

221012,"Alright, so one of my friends (still a minor) has told me about his depression and anxiety and sometimes he gets huge mental breakdowns/panic attacks where he starts venting. For now, all I have done is regularly talked to him about his depression and tried to calm him down during these breakdowns.

He has also told me that he has not told his parents about his depression out of fear of them worrying. He has also mentioned how his depression isn't even that big (even if it is very clear that it is) and that he wouldn't want to take the spot of someone who needs it more.

It has come to a point where I feel like I NEED to tell his parents about this. His parents need to know and they need to get him to a professional as soon as possible, wether he likes it or not.

221036,"24 male. I'm not sure what I'm feeling I've never gotten help and only recently opened up to a friend about how I have been feeling and what I have been thinking the past 5 or so years.
I've struggled the past couple of years working towards a trade I dont really want, dealing with the fact I have 0 relationship experience and kinda just wanting to isolate myself and just play on my PC at home after work. I'm also afraid to go for a walk outside my house or in my local town in case of being seen by old friends or people I used to know because I feel embarrassed/full of shame/guilt/anxious. 
I'm the eldest and have to set an example in my family and I absolutely love my younger siblings/parents and our dog. 
But I just cant shake the feeling that I'm just going to keep struggling on for however much longer before I most likely end it all myself. 
Been on lexapro for 2.5 years and all it has done has suppressed my feelings just so I can get through a days work. It mutes my mind of the depressive thoughts but in return I'm a lifeless zombie. 
I've no motivation or drive to get better.. for what ?",1,"24-year-old male has been depressed for the past 5 years. Has been on Lexapro for 2.5 years, but it does nothing to help him.

221039,"I have been feeling bad, seeing how the persons who I considered my friends do not care about me, do not text me, just look for me when they need something from me, that is breaking me out.

But the loneliness is on both sides of the issue, I can't keep burdening people with this shit every damn day. They don't feel the weight every day. They think they hear me once and we should be good, that's how it works in their brain so it must work the same way in mine?

No, the weight tumbles down the hill again every damn day. And nobody wants to stick around for it. Again and again. Not even me.",1,"Loneliness is on both sides of the issue.

221045,"I guess I'm still not in danger, because I thought when you're really in danger and you have a plan, you get a feeling of peace. At least I have some peace in the sense that, if I do get to where I can't think of any way not to go through with it, I've set out a couple of rules for myself to make the best of it. Like, I know where I'd do it, to make sure my kids aren't at risk of finding me. I'm finally drunk enough to stop fucking crying for the first time in... 14 hours now, looks like. Nothing's going to make this better. I'm in therapy. I'm on meds. My spouse is super supportive and I have literally everything to live for. And still here I am, thinking about how I'll make sure my kids have someone to look to when I'm gone. This is the only place I can say anything, because when I do make an attempt, I'm too careful to make a cry for help or try something that might not work. If it gets to that, nobody's going to know until I'm gone.

Just like when I called the suicide hotline 20 years ago, when I first had thoughts of dying, and I just sobbed that it was stupid of me to call because I was probably fine and they said okay. I'm way too self-controlled to say something like this if I were actually about to do something; I'd just do it. I'm so fucking tired of not being sick enough.

I'm not even looking for help. I can't imagine what anybody could do and I never get responses from anybody, anywhere. I just get more and more isolated as time goes on, the harder I work to face my fears and reach out. It's just that I don't have anybody else who understands. The people who care about me worry too much and my psychiatrist and therapist worry too little. I've never fit and I'm never going to.",1,"If I were about to commit suicide, I would make sure my kids have someone to look after them when I'm gone.
