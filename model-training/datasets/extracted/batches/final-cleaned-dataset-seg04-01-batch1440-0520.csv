25996,I am going to hang myself before the new year starts     I don t want to experience another year I am only   a lot of people will see this and think at first glance that i am only   and presume that i am simply going through faze  This is not the truth  I am a   year old college drop out living in rural north east England  All of my friends from school don t give two fucks about how i am  I don t blame them at all because they are busy living their best lives and enjoying being a young adult  fucking  partying  socialising in general and overall experiencing life as a young adult  I do not resent them for this at all  however  i will never be able to experience their lifestyle fully  no matter how many drugs ingest on a single night  I have   friend that i have happened to become attached too through mutual suffering  At the start me and this person shared a friendship through echo chamber like  conversation  they shared how fucked up they were and so did I  after awhile I decided to try bettering myself through exercise and anecdotal methods  went by in a flash  i tried every  Single  Method to try and turn my life around but everything failed It is now   and i ve given up    years of trying to get therapy and they ve just cancelled my listing because i was too depressed and suicidal to make a telephone appointment  so now i need to start all over again  I just told that  echo chamber  friend that i think about buying a gun and blowing my head off every day  their response   why would you tell me that when you know what  I M  going through  they never cared about me  they only liked the fact that i would listen to their problems  I rang them tonight to make sure they got the help they deserved when i m gone because I won t be here to give them advice So yeah  probably a shitty explanation of why but i m going to hang myself on new years eve and end the cycle  Peace,1,"A year old college drop out is depressed and suicidal.

25999,i wish i didn t have to be herehi  everything is too much i m not going to attempt because i know the people close to me will suffer and i haven t thought this through enough to create that big of a ripple in all of this  but i just now had the thought that i ve always been a void  and i think i can shape things around it  and bring it trinkets  and angle it with care to the right angles so it can look at pretty things in pretty light  but it doesn t care  i don t care  truly deeply and genuinely  i don t care  i ve never cared   to try to get this message across im gonna set this up  the me that sits under all the filler of personality and like  where im from  and the earth  behind everything  and i say  me  because i don t know what else to describe it as  it s not a separate entity or outside force  and the only reason  me  feels wrong is because of all that filler  this me  we will call Juliette  Juliette doesn t care it s all just fluff   it being literally everything else around me  and contrary to a lot of other people i ve talked to about this  my void doesn t consume things and make them bad  Juliette just  exists  and i don t think she was made for here  i m sick of everything happening all the time to me and around me  i feel like every time something happens in this reality it creates ripples and waves  and i m really  really tired of them hitting me  i m tired of being in the water at all  i want to wake up  i cant believe this is my existence  i cant believe juliette  i  was wasted on this painful fucking existence  and not that my existence would be more worth than someone else s  but just  a life  a grain of nothing turned into an even smaller grain of something for this  i cant believe it  nothing means anything,1,"Juliette is tired of everything happening all the time to her and around her.
