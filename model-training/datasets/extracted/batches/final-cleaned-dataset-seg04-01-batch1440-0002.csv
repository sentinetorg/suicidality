Thanks, but just like the patrols in a psych ward its a precautionary measure, when life is gone. The flame has sputtered out, and the engine of my existence had died. Im so low on the totem of existence i could be easily snuffed out by a strong wind. Im done waiting and watching and being watched. I appreciate the effort, but there is no good that can be done here. My life is garbage.

Its not your opinion. you cant control people, just yourself. and if you feel she doesnt appreciate you, then maybe its time for a change rather than death. getting a new gf is rough, but its better than biting the dust wouldnt you say.

55,"I dont do much currently. I lifeguard for a bit of cash. Im heading to school in September. That is pretty much it. As for whether its something I want to do; I have no idea. Currently I never feel like doing anything. What used to make me happy? Its been years since I was happy for more than a few minutes. I guess I like making things, programming, art, stuff like that. But I havent been able to concentrate much on anything, or I will plan something out, then just lose all drive and dont follow though on building it. Not really, the closest pool is a 15 to 25 minute drive. I guess I could try going there every once in a while. I swam so much, for so long, it didnt have much of an appeal over the last two seasons I competed. In the last few years I estimated that I was swimming somewhere around 3 million yards a year, I dont really feel like going back.

I dont do that anymore, but Im still physically healthy. I had a blood test, nothing showed up. I also take a multivitamin and eat fairly well. I honestly dont know. I if I had to guess, it would be that something is wrong with how my brain functions. Im not really stressed, I never have bee one to worry about much.Lately Ive just been wishing there was some way out, be it though medication or death or whatever.

57,"I saw them last December! Amazing music by amazing performers.What would you say your favourite album is? And, if youve got one, your favourite song?Its awesome that you even were in a band, by the way. Was it a metal band? Ive been playing six years, and Ive never been able to find a band. I think every guitarist is Tired self-critical - thats a great thing to be, although not overly so. To even perform in a band environment, you have to have good precision and rhythm, and flow with other players. With that in mind, Im sure youre a Tired good guitarist.

I just want to process others opinions and come to a decision, so your reply really helps There was a somewhat amusing line on TV the other day about how a writer could never commit suicide because theyd keep adding and adding to the note until it became a book, then a book series and so on. Theyd never be satisfied. Someone else then replied that a literature student couldnt either, because theyd be too busy researching and reading everyone elses notes and taking notes on how to write a note.

Let him know that you are not out to get him, tell him you love him. I dont know if this would help, but write him a letter. In this letter, write what you would want to say if he did do it. Unfortunately, people dont understand what they are to people. I still write my brother letters even though he is dead, telling him whats going on, so its like hes not even missing it.
