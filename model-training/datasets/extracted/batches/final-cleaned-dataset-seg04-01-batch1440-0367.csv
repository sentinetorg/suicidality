18349,I should just get it over with alreadyI m this point where everyone is sick of me and no one will help  I saw my psychiatrist and explained I ve been having breakdowns  panic attacks  and thoughts of suicide but when I met with her  I was in a upper mood  She told me I seemed fine and I would get over it  I went to my primary doctor but they didn t feel comfortable with making changes but they did make me sign a anti suicide agreement  Like that s really gonna stop me  My doctor referred me to a mental health facility to have a medication evaluation  I spent hours there only for them to tell me they can t see me for another four weeks   I ve struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life  I feel like I m meant to kill myself  It s bound to happen some time  I might as well get a jumpstart on the process   I feel utterly hopeless  Everything is a constant reminder of what a failure I am  I m always missing work or am behind because of how I feel  I can t share anything with anyone because the moment I did at my last job  everyone alienated me  Even though my boss s son committed suicide  My husband has a high stress job and struggles as well  now and in the past  His work offers confidential mental health support  which he has taken advantage of but somehow  everyone knows about his mental health and now he s being alienated  He s fallen back into cutting himself  Seeing his marks just makes me want to end it more  I wouldn t be such a burden to him if I was gone  He could focus on getting better without having to be weighted down by my baggage   My father had a addiction to prescription painkillers   Now I totally get why   easy to get a hold of and a great means of getting out of your head   I m trying so hard not to do it  I try to think of my husband  our two dogs and two cats and how they wouldn t understand but I m at my wits end,1,"At the end of the day, she is going to kill herself.
