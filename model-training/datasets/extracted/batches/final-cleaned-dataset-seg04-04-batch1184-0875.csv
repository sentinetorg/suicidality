221202,"I think this is the worst day of my life. 
I watched all Dr K and Reckful videos about his depression and they gave me a lot of hope. He seemed fine in his latest videos, and said he was genuinely happy after lunching his game. Got the news of his suicide on 7am, just 1 hour and a half before my driving license exam, which I worked so hard to pass, and failed because I was so out of it. As they say, suicide is contagious and I'm making a big effort to not fuck it up.

I've been depressed for almost 2 years now and when I was close to taking the fast exist I went to the doctor because that seemed like the only other solution to the problem. (This was on February)
The doctor gave me an appointment with a psych 3 months later, so I waited patiently with that date in my mind to remain strong. Then corona happened and it was delayed another 3 more months, being the new date the 7th of July. Some relatives have talked very recently about their medical appointments being cancelled because of little corona infections happening again and I'm so terrified. I'm to o scared to call and ask if it has been canceled. I don't think I can do this until September alone.
I also have the university entrance exam on 6th of July (2 days left) and I haven't even started to study because I simply can't do it so I have probably already ruined my future.

I just need something to tie me here, an upvote, a comment, something to watch at 4 am high and drunk wanting it all to end. Please, I beg you.

That was it, it's that hate that drove me forwards every single day to go outside of my comfort zone to be stronger. 

I am absolutely disgusted by my weakness. So much so, that I dont care how long it takes, or how much longer I have to stay here and work and struggle, I will one day eradicate all of my weakness.

I’m at a point in my life now where I no longer fear death, in fact , I think about death/not existing and fantasize about it all the time. I see photos of before I was born and I can’t help but get so happy an nostalgic at a world where I didn’t exist.

I had hopes of when I went into surgery a few months ago that I wouldn’t ever wake up again and I was so at peace with that. My doctors told me I was the calmest patient they ever saw before a surgery. Of course I was, I was so happy to be put under and escape this life in hopes I wouldn’t return. But here I am. 

I also fantasize about how much shit my coworkers talk of me... rationalizing even more how worthless I am and not deserving of the life I have. My family would be fine... this I do know. 

I had a close call a few days ago when a car coming the opposite direction crossed the yellow line and I have never felt more calm than in that moment. I was so ready. 

I’m chicken shit for being a pussy about how to kill myself... but I fantasize about how I would do it all the time. It consumes any spare time I have. I intentionally block times off to think and imagine a world where I don’t exist. 

I get so excited when I have the house to myself, too. I slam my head into the corners of the walls and will starve myself as punishment. It feels so good to do these things.

When I'm happy, I'm sad because I know this won't last and the thing that is waiting for me will come sooner rather than later. 

When I'm sad, I no longer feel the full extent of the emotion. I'm almost numb, the blows keep coming, I just don't care anymore. I know where I'm headed.

It's the anger that gets me. I'm angry at everything and because I'm angry at everything I see sides of myself I wish I never would. It reaffirms that I shouldn't be here. If there's one good thing I can do, it's remove myself from this planet.",1,"Suicidal thoughts used to come and go, but now they're always there.

I was also able to talk to them about the rape I experienced just over 4 months ago which despite the 'impossibility' (age/menopause) resulted in pregnancy.  Due to a heart condition (amongst other things) I am not expected to survive the birth but I cannot change the situation or deny this child the right to his or her life.  So, I had my friend tell my LDL that I was already dead.  I thought that way I could at least support him.  Of course I wasn't expecting things to work out the way they did

2 days ago was the last day of school where I live and we had a really long talk. We are „bus buddies“ but no bus drove this late on that day, we were on a party that day. 

He confessed that he has been cutting himself and 1 day earlier was about to jump in front of a truck that was driving by. He said that if he lost his best friends he wouldn’t have any reason to live. I don’t know if I can help him but maybe there is something. His best friends also know that he‘s suicidal.

I‘m scared that he‘ll take his live soon.

I'm really struggling and have already decided on what i'm going to do, so please don't go down that road. What I need help with is this. Should I write letters for my children to read when they are old enough?

I doubt they would ever get them, their mother would probably destroy them if it were her responsibility and tell the kids lies. I doubt giving them t my side of the family will help much either, pretty sure she will drop contact the moment i'm gone. 

Is it too much to do that? too much for them to deal with long after they have forgotten me?
