221053,"Okay so to preface this is in no way sexual, it’s purely just a form of escapism that has developed for me the last few days or so. I’m posting this wondering if anyone else can relate to this. 

Lately I’ve started getting deep into this fantasy of inciting my own murder. I imagine how I would find someone to do it, what they would look like, how they would do it, etc. Like today I’ve been thinking about a timeline where I post on reddit somewhere inciting for someone to kill me. They contact me and I tell them that I want to be shot point blank from behind while I’m walking somewhere. We pick the date and the location and discuss what to do with my body. I’ve been constantly thinking about a way I can escape all this pain I’m in all the time and it’s gotten to the point where the thought of someone murdering me is more comforting than the thought of having to live any longer. I feel like everything in my life is telling me that I should die. I’m considering going to this bridge that goes over the river in my city, it’s very high up. I want to just sit on the edge at the top of it and look at the water and feel how high up I am. The thought of that is also comforting. If I felt like it I could just jump off and it would all be over. If I got drunk and went up there I know I would do it. I have no doubt. I guess I’m just conflicted. I’m still trying to hold onto hope but I don’t think I can ever really get better. I feel like my issues are too ingrained and there’s too many. Even if I could fix them do I have it in me to work that hard for that long? I hate myself so deeply I don’t even think I deserve to feel better if I’m honest. I don’t know what I’m talking about anymore. This post went on a complete tangent.

221059,"I keep looking back on my life, and I can't help but feel like the universe is trying to kill me.

Literally from the moment I was born, I had a breathing issue that had to be dealt with. Less than a year later, I got a very bad case of the flu and had to get hospitalized. A few years ago, I slipped on something (still no idea what the fuck it was), hit my head, and could've bled out if the doctor hadn't hurried the fuck up.

I'm also being driven to suicide by bullshit that's not my fault. I'm bisexual, so of course both of my parents seem to be biphobic. I've been to four different schools, two of which have consisted of mostly bullies and homophobes. At one of my schools, even the teachers hated me even though I was a well behaved student. It also doesn't help that I'm autistic, so going through all of this shit while only being able to keep one friend is tough.

On the topic of my one friend, for literally no reason, I've just lost all interest in talking to him. I like him and he's really nice, I just lost interest for no reason. Then that makes me feel lonely, and I feel horrible for not wanting to talk to him, which makes me even more depressed and even closer to suicide.

There are only two things that have stopped me from suicide. One is my cat, one of the few beings on this planet who actually fucking cares about me. The other is just a lack of planning. I don't know how I would even do it.

If the universe is out to kill me, can it please hurry? I want to fall asleep tonight and never wake up. That would literally be the best thing to ever happen to me. If I died tonight, my one friend and my cat would be upset. Everyone else would get over it within 2 weeks I feel like.",1,"I feel like the universe is trying to kill me.

Hour by hour I can feel myself slipping. I have almost no hope left. I don’t talk to anyone at all, haven’t for a week, it’s just been me, a game and my thoughts. For me, there is no help. No medicine, no therapy is going to bring back what I lost. I can’t fight anymore. I’m so tired of holding on. I don’t even know if I should wait another day, to see if the person I love will come back, or a few days until my mail comes, or just do it now in the dead of night.

221089,"The only thing I’m good at is sleeping and I can’t even do that anymore, it’s 3am and I’m wide awake just wanting to die, if that’s not a fat mood idk what is. I plan on ending things next week for good this time - life has no meaning anymore and this feeling of emptiness inside me is too much to bare. Rn the only thing keeping me going is knowing how upset my best friend and mum would be but even that’s fading now and I’ve written my suicide note. Everything’s fallen apart - my relationships, friendships, I’m not me anymore and I feel drained like I’ve been so busy trying to fix other people, there’s nothing left of me and I can’t get it back. The prospect of uni doesn’t even excite me anymore, I really want my time on this earth to end so I don’t have to keep waking up every morning to the same feeling of worthlessness that haunts me but I’m scared it’s going to hurt and I won’t just slip away peacefully like I intend. 
Everyone keeps telling me things will get better but I truly don’t believe they will and my mindset doesn’t have the will power to change. I honestly feel drained like I’m a shell of a person whose just existing because of biological functions like eating and breathing but I’m not living and I don’t want to live if I’m honest. The world is so incredibly full of evil and suffering with people being the most cruel of all, I don’t want to go on like this. Thankyou for giving me somewhere to vent.",1,Everything in my life has fallen apart and I want to end it all. The prospect of uni doesn't excite me anymore.

221092,"I'm miserable, every day I wake up with no excitement or joy just kind of dead. I feel like I have no emotion no happiness only a lurking sense of anxiety. My mind is static, I don't even really think about anything. I haven't looked forward to anything in years. I haven't had a job since February, I'm out of money. Honestly thinking I'd rather be homeless or kill myself than find another dead end job that drains me and pays me nothing. I just so over it. If it wasn't for my pets I'd have killed myself or disappeared myself onto the streets by now. I know my partner can care for my cat and my parents can care for my dog, but they're the only thing I love and care about and I worry that they'll miss me.

221095,"Been on and off the suicide idea for fucking almost a decade at this point and I've sorta rationalized this deathwish is gonna be a forever issue. I've found a way to help is not to just try to do positive things or things you enjoy but to do positive things that you enjoy. Gotta put em together. I've been painting 40k minifigures and going on regular bike rides though the forest near my place. Im in a better mood lately and have actual motivation for work. The thoughts going away i know damn well won't happen. My medication has even been messing the thoughts up even more, giving me motivation to do risky things and generally making me give less fucks than normal. Also being social impacts it a lot too. I have no friends except work friends and they can be incredibly grating to talk to. There are days i don't even speak a single damn word when not at work. So yeah, telling people to do things that'll help like a hobby isn't entirely ignorant if you're willing to ACTUALLY MAKE THE FUCKING EFFORT TO CHANGE. YES I KNOW IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE MOTIVATION TO DO ANYTHING BUT HEAVENS TO BETSY IT WORKS WONDERS WHEN YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU ENJOY.",1,"Suicide has been an issue for almost a decade.

221098,"People tell you that you are a good friend, and a good listener. They like you because you can give advice and they think that you are happy and a great person.

When you feel bad and need someone to talk to, you talk to that person that told you that you can count with, no matter what. 

You speak to them, telling them that you are actually depressed and feel bad. Some of them will tell you that they feel worse and start talking about themselves, and others will feel that you’re just pretending to be sad and playing with the word “depression” or “anxiety” as everyone does. 

Some of them, and I don’t if they are the worst or best ones, get away from you. They notice that you aren’t the one that they were seeking for in their lives, and some of them want to protect themselves, or they are just not interest on having a depressed fucking friend because it is BORING and sad to give advice and love to one of them. 

YOU LOVE and trust in someone again, and feel like they like you too and they care about you, you think they are your friends but when you need help they don’t like you anymore and you don’t have that person in your life that made you think that you are a little bit more important in the world.
