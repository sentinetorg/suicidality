30149,The date was a success  And you know how  Because it ended with kisses  So first I had to pick her up and meet her parents  I made sure to say I m going into the military  Then we went to the mall  went window shopping  and got bubba tea  m amp ms  and Doritos  After that we picked up spray paint and went to a bridge she goes to all the time we held hands in the car  I already came up with my own signature and we made sure to write  Fuck Trump  After that I took her to my place  We finished off the fireball I his in my room and then watched some of The Boys since I love the show  My friends came over and we went with them to one of their houses in the neighborhood  here comes my favorite part  So we sat together on a chair  she was like halfway on my lap and snuggling me  I then got the courage to ask to kiss her by just saying  kiss  And she said yes  And my god she s the best kisser ever  The only make out session I ve had involved the girl chewing on my face  But this girl used her teeth in such a gentle and hot way  And her lips were so soft  I just kept asking to kiss her lol  But yeah  I m really happy tonight  but I have to get thrown right back into the real world tomorrow,0,"The date ended with kisses.
