127122,Seriously thinking about ending my life It all started with my depression and anxiety when I was a young teen  and then my life went to shit just as I finished school  I have been facing an internal battle for years and I have problems with even the tiniest of things  Can hardly get my sorry ass up out of bed in the morning  usually just asking myself  what s the point  Why do I even bother   I ve tried talking to people but they just laugh and say  you ll be fine  everyone feels like that  stop feeling sorry for yourself  it will go away soon   lt lt lt  Yeah right  then why the heck am I posting here   I m loosing the battle with myself all those fake smiles and laughs that I give people I can t do it anymore Sometimes I don t even know who I am anymore  I get so aggressive and angry  I even tend to burst out in tears at random for no reason  Then I started having an identity crisis  and I still do  because I can t even describe a single thing about me that I like or that makes me special I ve gathered up the courage to kill myself once and almost succeeded  tried to hang myself on a blind cord  it seemed like the best idea at the time but  it snapped and I just gave up and cried feeling unsatisfied and empty  Nobody knew what happened  no one was home at the time  it was planned that way I ve attempted to try again with a knife and scissors  which have now been confiscated  my parents don t believe me  just say  don t be silly  and even go as far as planning precisely how I am going to end my life  Date time place etc   I ve seen a Psychologist  didn t help much  if anything it just made me think that I wasn t worthy enough to be on this planet in the first place  I ve taken anti depressants too  they don t work for shit   So I m thinking about it again considering how little I ve contributed to the world I figure no one would miss me  A fitting ending for me  no friends  no future,1,"As soon as he finished school, my life went to shit.
