168134,Im scared of myself I was very young when i first started to consider suicide and   years later  the only thing that has changed is that i have gone from fighting it to accepting it  I understand that suicide is a selfish concept but why should i continue to live if everyday is a struggle to me  I don t want to have to force myself to wear a fake smile to make my friends and family happy anymore  None of them understand what i go through and neither do i  I just get so irrationally upset about everything and no one is there yet its expected i be there for my friends  I feel like im empty inside and sometimes i find myself crying for no reason  These thought about suicide used to only occur when i was upset but they are now with me all the time  When im crossing the road i would be thinking about how easy it would be to step out in front of a car and for it to end  Its never going to go away and im going crazy because of it,1,Suicide is not an option for her anymore.

168136,Realization I ve had social anxiety for the past three years and I think the cause of it is because me and my family migrated and I know how to speak English but too shy to speak to  people so they think that I just lack vocabulary and treat me like I m fucking stupid they don t treat me badly but just treat me differently like I m an outcast I moved schools three times and I thought that I made friends but then realized that no one would actually care if I die or just disappear I tried so hard getting people s validation and tried to be my best self I tried exercising  meditation and all kinds of different shit that I thought would actually help me but nothing helps I feel drained  irritated and everything moves so slow most of the time I just feel like everyone just thinks I m retarded the only thing that I wanted is a one real friend that would actually care but everytime I think of it I just see blur and I m surrounded by narcissistic and egotistical friends that have crab mentality that will pull me down just for them to look better to people,1,"Social anxiety has been a problem for me for the past three years.
