51297,Meaningless universeI m not quite suicidal  though I ve thought about it several times  I created this throwaway account to hide my identity  Anyway  I basically just find life completely meaningless   We re just living organic tissue  natural processes combined in a particular way with a particular form   Most of us won t be remembered for very long after we die even the most famous people are eventually forgotten or only remembered by a few academic types   And of course in time the world will end anyway probably sooner than later  though at the latest in   billion years when the sun expands  So it will be as if we never even existed  any of us  ever  Just a bunch of cold space and mindless matter going through the dull clockwork over and over again Now I have a friend who is on the verge of suicide  And here s the worst part and which contributes to my own thoughts of suicide  I can t get myself to care about him or his life that much  I find myself somewhat indifferent  though rationally I know that I should care and should be doing all I can to prevent his suicide  My attitude  strange enough  is that if he wants to do it he should   I know that s wrong  rationally  but the emotional attachment to him or to anyone else is either not there at all or is there only in small amounts  So I am an empty shell of a human  living an empty meaningless life in an essentially meaningless futile universe   Why not just kill myself  And let others do the same Now like I said earlier  I m not totally on the verge of suicide myself  Because I don t know if I have the guts to do it  Plus  in my view now  living is just as meaningless as suicide  so why not just live  At least for now,1,Life is meaningless and we won't be remembered after we die. I have a friend who is on the verge of suicide and I can't get myself to care about him or his life. I don't know if I have the guts to commit suicide. ,life meaningless not remember die friend verge suicide not care life not know gut commit suicide
