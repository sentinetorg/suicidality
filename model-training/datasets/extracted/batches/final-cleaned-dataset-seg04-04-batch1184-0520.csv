203474,Casual discrimination may be a good thing  Of course all the BLM and LGBTQ movements are valid and whatnot Things like  bro are you gay or what  May be beneficial  It helps build up tolerance and people who be less touchy and whatnot  It can also form some sort of a collective mindset as people are comfortable with joking about one s race religion sexuality  This may lessen the impact of actual slurs  It also help drive away racist movements and whatnot since it is a harsh love sort of acceptance towards a community  Obviously there must be a mutual consent and understanding so that people who are conscious about their differences don t get hurt or take it as a personal attack  I m thinking of this solution being somewhat similar to how people make dark jokes about suicide and depression anxiety to help feel better or have a laugh about it  For example  my friends and I often laugh about how asians are supposed to be smart but really we are both really dumb WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENCE CUZ APPARENTLY GOD CREATED THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND NOW IM GRADED ON IT  WHAT THE FUCK MAN Obviously slurs such as the n words or f got should be of the table especially in this very tense global situation when it comes to gay rights and racial equality  and should only be used by the respective communities if they want to  take back  the slur or show that they are not affected by it anymore   I do recognise that it may just backfire or be an excuse for people to insult another community  But I m also saying that it might work and help build resistance against prejudice descrimination  However I am interested in what other people thoughts and opinions are,0, Casual discrimination may be a good thing. It helps build up tolerance and people who be less touchy. It may lessen the impact of actual slurs. It might also drive away racist movements.
